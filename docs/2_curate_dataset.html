<p>Here, we are able to glimpse at the files in the dataset and see what we need to “tidy” in order to make the data more consistent. We see that there are periods dividing the title of the show, and then we see that there are letters (S and E) attached to the season number and episode number which is used to help identify which is which. For our purposes, we will have columns for each, so we do not need the defining S and E in our dataset. We also see that the files are .srt files, so we must also get rid of this as well.</p>

<p>We see that this dataset is structured very similarly. We see our <code>doc_id</code> variable consists of the title of the series, the season number, the episode number, and extra information that we need to get rid of to make the dataset comparable with our Love on the Spectrum data.</p>

<p>Here, after separating our columns, we unite the columns that correspond with one another; therefore, we will combine columns 1 through 3 and redefine this variable as “Series.” We see that this dataset has an extra variable, “Episode Title.” This information is not necessary for our analysis, so we can remove this variable so that the structure of the two datasets are the same.</p>

<p>Our next step is to write the edited data by using the write_csv() code. We want to put our datasets in the <code>data/derived/</code> folder and from there, we want to put them in their respective folders. I recommend that you create the file folders for the two datasets in the <code>data/derived</code> folder so they do not get confused with one another.</p>

We get clean datasets (columns and rows that are better organized) for both Love on the Spectrum and Love is Blind so we are able to analyze the data easier.</p>
