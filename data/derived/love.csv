Love On The Spectrum,01,01,"What do you think love is? It'll be like a fairy tale. A natural high, I suppose? Gets your heart racing. Can make people do crazy things. You just feel very warm inside yourself as a person. So, have you ever been in love? No. Have you been in a relationship? No. Have you been on a date? No. That was too awkward. Some girls don't feel like dating with someone with disabilities. Beep, beep, bi, boop. An A-plus partner looks like me. Oh! Would you like to get married? Um... ""The course of true love never did run smooth."" Of course it doesn't. You ready? Yes, ready. Hello. My name is Michael, and I happen to be a 25-year-old man. How do you feel about being on the spectrum? Well, autism is just a neurological disability. People with Asperger's or autism, they just learn things a different way. As far as I'm concerned, if anything, it's actually more of a gift. And are you looking for love, Michael? Oh, yes, I am. I would like to start dating. I just, um... don't really know how to get started, because... I've tried numerous ways, and they've all been unsuccessful. What's your greatest dream in life? To become a husband. can be difficult. This room here is my bedroom, but I actually call it my quarters. It's the main place in this world that I feel safe. These are my love ducks. If you are single and seeking love, sit them beside your bed and love is sure to come your way. I actually bought them from a store in Newtown six years ago. Excuse me a second, gentlemen. Oh, what is that? It's a plaque. I actually made it specifically for my future wife. When did you make this? Five years ago. Wow, you really want this, Michael! Oh, yes, I do. It's most important thing that I want to achieve. Well, I hope we can help you achieve that. I really hope so, too. I seriously do. his first dating experience I often compare myself to Adam, my brother, a lot, which is a big mistake. I would often label him as a fresh cut of meat from God, and myself as a double scoop of dog shit. Why on earth he wanted to compare himself to me, I don't know, but... It's because I've often felt inferior to my brother. Adam was able to get himself in a relationship easily, whereas I had trouble doing so. The challenges that you face, Mike, I think a lot of other people face, too. To struggle at some point or another to find, like, proper love. But for some strange reason, I don't seem to recall Adam having any problems like that. Because we're all different. But Michael, you've seen over the past few years, how it just hasn't worked out for me either. Like, it just turns to shit. That's also because a lot of people our age aren't interested in commitment. They're only interested in intercourse. Yeah. Look, it's true. Oops. Dad, did you drop your food? Yeah. And also... I've also... What I've also noticed with a lot of girls your age, Liv, when they're still in high school, they only want a boyfriend for... Intercourse. Not just... Not just for intercourse, but also as a bodyguard and as a sugar daddy. I think every family needs a Michael. It just adds something different. Hi, I'm Chloe. I'm 19, and I'm autistic. I was born, well, not completely deaf, but never been able to hear fully. I have hearing aids, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Have you ever been in love? N... Not romantic love. I don't know what it's like to fall in love or have a crush. So, have you ever dated? Yes, I have. I once dated a guy who, when I told him that I was autistic, he left me, because he didn't want to be associated with someone who's autistic. How did that make you feel? Well, I was a bit... angry, or I was confused. I was like, is autism really bad? And you accept your autism? Yes, I do. Took me a while, but I do, yes. When I tell someone I'm autistic, people go, ""Really? No, you're not. You don't look autistic."" And I can say, ""What does an autistic person look like?"" less likely than boys to be diagnosed. as we learn more I want to experience love. I want to be like everyone else, you know? I just don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I see so many people holding hands and kissing and doing all that, and that's something I want. I had, like, all these ideas in my head, and none of them happened. Life is not a movie. What's up, man? Come here. When you start doing the whole dating thing, that fairy-tale thing, it's gonna take a while to get to that. Yeah, I know. So, you know, don't expect that as the first one, because it's not an easy situation to get into. I'd like someone who I can talk to about Marvel, or, you know... Exactly. ...new cartoons and animes coming out. So, I'll go and crack on and start doing some dinner stuff. Remember, not touching. It won't be touching, Chloe. It won't be touching, I promise. I'm very picky when it comes... I don't like things touching other things. The beans have to be separated. Like, a little bit of beans on the side, they can't touch. All right, let them start warming. She's a really intelligent girl. She's, you know, incredibly intelligent, but socially, she's not. She's often had a lot of problems with difficulties reading someone's emotions. It's a lot harder to make a friendship. So, to move onto anything intimate, I think it would be a huge challenge. From the little girl that couldn't say any words to me, to the day she said ""daddy"" for the first time, to where she is now, yeah, I'm hugely proud of where she's come from. She's... She's done fantastically. She's, um... yeah. After everything she's had against her. Yep, sorry. No, you're all right. Yeah, no, she's done really well. I used to get bullied quite a lot in school in England for how I look. I got called names, I got pushed, I had, you know, my work ripped up, and called me deaf, and then I got called ""skeleton."" I think, you know, being bullied has made me who I am, and if I wasn't bullied, I would've been someone completely different. several times a week. Do you want milkshake or tea? A tea. A tea? Yeah. Yeah? What do you want? I don't know. Same as you. Yeah. Yeah. My friend Brodie has Down's syndrome, and she's mute and deaf, but she signs, and I sign a lot, and we're like this. You know, can't separate us. And we cause... We get told we cause a lot of trouble, and... You know, we just don't follow the rules. Oh, look, Brodie, boy! You like him? You gonna talk to the boys? Come on. Come on. Come on, talk to the boys. No, you! You! Hey. Want to talk? Hello. Come here. I don't know their names. Cheeky. You're cheeky. No, you're cheeky. A lot of things happen when me and Brodie go out. I just think she's this amazing person, and she's absolutely amazing to be around. I just find it sad that some people just look at her for, you know, what she looks like, and just, uh... you know, judges her. Yeah, you're cheeky. Hello. Um, my name is Ruth Garlick, and, uh, I'm 22 years old, and, um... I'm primarily a deaf autistic. And who's this? What's this? Oh, this is my baby snake Cleopatra. She helps me to stay calm. And it means I don't have a lot of sensory overload when I'm handling her. Can you describe your ideal partner? Oh, sure, um... My ideal... ideal partner would be a blondie who's a big cuddler. He also needs to be able to be okay with my quirks and my nerdiness. He's just over there. Come along. Hey, gorgeous. Hello. I'm Thomas. We've been, um, dating for... about four years now, and I think we do all right together. Thomas, what do you love about Ruth? She's funny, fun to be with, um... r-really smart... a-a-a killer body, and just puts up with me. Yeah, he loves my body, that's why he stays with me. I... I really do. It's sexy. Sexy. I think we do work well together. I'm autistic enough to understand Ruth, and she can understand me back. Likening it to curry, she's a very spicy chicken tikka masala, but I'm... I'm a nice... nice mild, um, butter chick... No, I'm a... I'm a mango chicken. I've decided I want to be a mango chicken. Yeah, so basically, I'm fire, and he's water. And together, fire and water, things get steamy. That's true. That's very naughty. Yes, it is. just over a year ago. This is my card collection. This here's thick. So it's quite heavy. This is one of my favorite sections, which is food. So you collect business cards? Yes, I do. What's your guess at how many you have? How many? Um, probably thousands. Look, there's... This is a lot. I can't wait to sort them all out. I don't think I've ever met anyone who collects business cards. Well, autistic people are known for being pretty unusual. This is my garden railway. A garden is your own idea of heaven. So, of course, mine's gonna have a train running through it. When did you guys first meet? My sister told me that, um, she knew another aspie at church, and, uh, she wanted me to meet him, because she thought we'd become friends. We immediately understood each other. We... And I actually... When we first met each other, I wrote in my journal, ""Oh, I want to marry this guy."" I didn't know that. That's true. I told you that before. Likes her milk. That's why I need to go buy some. What's that picture on the fridge? That one? Hmm. Ruth drew that for my birthday. ""Happy birthday, Tom, from your crazy girlfriend Ruthy."" And then that is, um, runes. Can't wait to marry you. I love you, Ruth. Apparently, it says that. If I actually was dating somebody, and I actually entered a relationship, and then eventually... married her, I would treat her as my top priority. She would be pretty much my most valuable and greatest treasure of all time. She'd practically be my million dollars. Mike, can you get me some salt? Yeah. You mean the sea salt? Yep. Please. Why do you think Michael's finding it hard to meet someone? I think he just needs to find somebody that's like-minded. I don't think he wants anybody loud. Or gothic. Mm-hmm. Or tomboyish. Mm-hmm. Or practically any girl that acts like... like she's still in high school. Yeah. Sounds right. If she's the right person for me, then... I'll... I'll consider proposing to her. Okay. By coincidence, I've already decided on the perfect wedding ring for my partner. In the form of a crown... to signify that she'll be my queen, per se. But I'm not really too keen on kids at the moment, because... I have a feeling that having children will ruin my chances of becoming wealthy. They kinda do. But what if you meet a girl that wants to have children, and you're like, ""Oh, but that's gonna take away from my bank account."" What are you gonna do? I'll simply tell her, ""Okay, I'll allow it, but on one condition. I get a vasectomy after the second child."" Okay. I've been single for 25 years. I'm not too willing to be single for another 25. What if you are? Mum. I still refuse to take that for an answer. But it's not an answer. I'm just saying, it's a hypothetical what-if. Not what if. It will. Okay. That's it. Not what if. It will. It will. Okay. It will. who works with people on the spectrum. When they're children, there's a lot of support given to people with autism about social skill and social interaction. And I think when people reach adulthood, and they're really looking for intimate relationships, I think that we don't give a lot of support to understanding the really great complexity... ...of flirting with somebody else, or how do we develop an intimate relationship with somebody else? Hello. Hello. You must be Jodi. Yes, hello. Are you Michael? Yes, I am. Where do people meet each other when they're on the autism spectrum? People go onto sort of a mainstream dating site, and then do you out yourself as being on the spectrum, which is really complex? I've never had a partner before. I've always had some trouble trying to find a partner. Why do you think that is? Well, a lot of girls that I've been friends with in the past, a... a lot of those friendships have turned out to be quite... disappointing. Do you have trouble with understanding another person's body language? I have very little trouble. Facial expressions always give something away. That's great. It's excellent that you say that. Because some people on the spectrum, they really have difficulty with that. So that's excellent that you've got that ability to do that. Yeah. Yes. When I'm with somebody, if they're trying to mask... mask something... He knows. ...on their face, I'll just simply say, mask it all you want, but I know what you're actually feeling. Yes! Really? He... And you know what, he's so good at it. He's so... Even with people he's just met. I've been studying human behavior for many years. That's excellent, Michael. Specifically in women. Yeah. Oh. It's because I've always taken a bit of an interest in it, in a... in a strange way. No, that's not strange. Do you know what, if you're on the autism spectrum, and you find body language difficult, actually studying body language is a really important thing to do. I was told that nonverbal cues, he'll never be able to get. Excuse me, nonverbal cues? Look at his gift. I was told, ""Oh, you know, you'll... you'll probably never hear him say I love you."" They said he probably won't have any empathy for others. Biggest bunch of rubbish I ever heard. It's just a difference in the way that they do things. They're just different, that's it. And people with autism have incredible affection... Yes. ...and deep love. Yes! Really wanting to connect. When people talk to Michael, they might find him a bit of an oddball, a bit quirky, and stuff like that. But the thing is, we've raised him and taught him... to be confident with himself, and that, you know what? Even as so-called ""normal people,"" we don't have all the answers. But you two have obviously done a really, really fantastic job as parents. They haven't given me everything. Not everything, but plenty. Which is still adequate. Which is still adequate? Yes. Yep. What's the difference between... friendship and a girlfriend? Girlfriends, they're more serious, it's more intimate, and there's no hands-to-yourself business. Okay, hang on, hang on. So, it's more... Because that's... Tell me the difference. It's more serious... What do you mean by more serious? When I say serious... Yeah. ...you make the decision to... Yeah. ...to kiss each other or, um... We don't talk to Mum and Dad about kissing, do we? No. N-Not... Not really. I never really thought about that. Because, you see, I've never... never had any interest in having... in having sexual intercourse as... if you will. Um... Okay, this is where I exit. Yeah. I have to say, that could be a good time. Thanks very much for coming. We'll leave you guys to it. And, like, one of my philosophies is, never fall for a girl just because she's hot. I think that's an excellent philosophy. I made that up myself. Did you? It's a good... It's a very good one. So, when we're going on a first date, what we're doing is we're trying to find out have we got enough things in... ...common. ...common. What would be one thing that you can think of if you could make a girlfriend, what would be something that you're into and that she's into? There is a hobby that I enjoy doing. I actually tend to do this one in secret. That's toy collecting. If you don't have enough things in common, what do we do? Not bother with another date. We don't just give up, we keep going, because we just have to keep finding... Yeah. ...that person that's gonna be your person with enough in common with you. Yeah. I'd really like for you to let me know how you go on your dates, and especially to find out if you've been able to find somebody that you have common interest with. Okay. It was lovely to meet you. Like... Likewise. Take care of yourself. See ya. And good luck. Thanks. Thanks for your time. Are you open to dating people who might have a disability or a condition? Oh, yes. And I think dating someone who's on the autistic spectrum, or someone, you know, with disabilities might be better. I might... I might have, um... be able to talk to them more about it and not feel like I have to be fake and be someone completely different. Hello. Hello, miss. Yeah. If you need to, just, you know, twiddle your fingers or something, if you're getting a little bit nervy. And you can always excuse yourself, you need to powder your nose or something. Okay, but I don't have nose powder. No, no. It's... It's a saying, isn't it. You go for... go for a wee. Oh, okay. But it's not honest. That's true. Maybe you could say, I'm just gonna just pop to the bathroom. Okay. And you can have a little bit of time. Okay. All right? Just... Just ask him what he likes, and... boom, if there's a connection, it's a connection. Hmm. between his toes. Hello. Hello. I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Here you go. Oh, thank you so much. They're lovely. Thank you. Thank you. So, how are you? I'm pretty good. Yeah? You nervous? Yeah, I am. What do you like? Do you have any hobbies? I like to go to, um... to the gym. Oh, gym? To be honest, I have never set foot in a gym. Mmm. Never. Not my thing. Yeah. So, do you like reading? Like, do you know any good books? I do read sometimes, but not a lot... Yeah. ...because, um... Well, actually, I didn't learn how to fully read until I was 13. Oh, really? Yeah. I couldn't speak until I was seven. I still have a lisp, but I'm deaf, so... Oh, okay. Autistic, deaf. Yeah. Yeah. Can't speak properly. Yeah, the whole package, I guess. Um... Do you want to go inside for dinner? Yeah, sure. Okay. Oh, she's pretty cool. You know, it's going pretty well so far. I hope it can... only go up from here, you know? So, have you ever, like, dated before? Never. Oh, never? Never. This is the very first one... Oh, really? ...I've ever had, ever. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. So, are you interested in, like, any specific type of person or... I thought I was interested in guys at one point, but then I tried watching a little bit of, uh, gay porn, and... Okay. It didn't... It didn't work out. No? Okay. And I did not like what I saw. Oh, okay. And I didn't feel anything. So, you're sure you're definitely straight? Yeah. Yeah. How about you? Um, well, I'm openly bi, but I dated, uh, a few girls before, a few guys, it's just, you know, I'm just trying to find the right person. True that. Yeah. It's like, um... I like Asians. Oh, Asians? Yeah. Okay. I'm a... I'm an Asian, and... Okay, yeah. I'm not Asian. Okay. I also like Mexicans. I like them, too. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. My, um... Oh. Trout, guys? Um, the steak and the... and the chips. Fish is right over here. Thank you. Thank you. No worries. Enjoy, guys. That's what I'm talking about. Do you like Spider-Man? Yeah, I do. Who's your favorite Spider-Man? Um... Tobey Maguire. Oh. That is my favorite. Oh, you see... I quite like Andrew Garfield, but I think Tom Holland, the current one, he's all right, but... Yeah, he's, um... No, he's an actual kid, so... He's okay. He didn't tickle my fancy. I guess... Hmm. Hm. This has been a really nice date, but I think it's getting a bit late. Thank you. Yeah. I had a nice time tonight. Thank you. Thank you for the flowers, they're lovely. No problem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye! Goodbye. Bye! There wasn't really, like, a spark, and it was a bit awkward for both of us. It's kind of been, like, a learning experience, made me realize I like girls a bit more... than men. Are you guys in love? What'd he say? Are we in love? Um... We're a bit more than in love. Because we were a bit desperate, when we hit rough roads... ...we just decide to cling on even more. It's just nice and warm and comfortable and stable now, I think. Steady. Yeah, yeah. We're comfortable farting in front of each other. Yeah, that. Hello, Munchkin. I've struggled my whole life with friends, and I've mostly really had friends of the animal, imaginary kinds. It would be nice to have a real-life friend, I guess, but I don't know if I will find one. So, for the moment, I've basically just latched onto Tom. That... That one wasn't good enough. We have to do it again. No, we don't! Yes, we do. No, we certainly do not. I love my job. It's really relaxing just driving around, looking at the scenery. Initially, as a railway enthusiast, I was a bit, ""Ew, buses, they're common."" Very, uh, snobbish of me. But I then thought, you know, while I couldn't find work, maybe give them a try. And here I am, and I absolutely love it, uh... Best job I've ever had. Just around the corner is a house Ruth and I are currently dreaming about buying. Really nicely located next to the railway station. It'd be nice to spend the afternoon on the balcony, just watching the buses and the trains driving past. I saw the bus come along, and I just jumped on... ...and then, for some reason, Tom was in free dress... ...and I had no idea why. Aren't you supposed to be in uniform? What? What? What?! Serious? Yeah. I told you I couldn't afford a ring. I already bought it. Really? Yeah. Really?! Oh, for goodness' sake, just put it on! And say yes. Come here. When it comes to physical beauty, my idea is, a woman has to be beautiful, but not to the point where she looks like a model on a runway. Definitely not. That's too beautiful. Pretty much a fifty-fifty-looking girl. That would be the best. by a local disability organization. Hi, Michael. Hello, Tamika. How are you? I'm good, yourself? I'm great. So, what are your hobbies? Ten-pin bowling, pool, um, watching television... Nice. Now, that's nice. Yeah. And what are yours? Mine is basketball, soccer, football... Ever since I was a little girl, I always used to love sport. Ah, so you're a bit of a tomboy type. Correct, I am. Ah. Who's got the Mediterranean pasta? Here. Thank you. That's me. There you are. Thank you. Oh, have any of you seen Yes! ""Oh, SpongeBob. If only you could see how stupid you sound right now."" ""I love money! Money, money, money, money, money."" ""Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab."" ""But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy! And what could be better than serving up smiles?"" Mm-hmm. Are you a beer drinker, Michael? Nope. No? I've always hated beer. I don't even drink wine either. I hate it. Oh, wow. You see, I'm a different kind of man. I'm actually a teddy bear. Aw, that's nice. I like that. Hello. Hello. Name's Michael. Nice to meet you, Michael. I'm Carli. Nice to meet you, Carli. What do you do for work? Um... I... I run my own business. Wow. But sometimes there have been complications. Like, the financial side on the business, it's... become a bit, not blocked, but clogged up. You know what I mean? Yeah. But I've asked a friend of mine, ""Ah, can you fix that?"" ""Yeah, I'll fix it, I know what it is."" Ah. So, I can easily deal with that, 'cause see... Yeah. For instance, I've gotta do it tomorrow morning, because I've... Probably tomorrow afternoon. See if I can keep going on the... on the business stuff. But if it has to wait till the weekend, and then she sees it and goes, ""Oh, yeah, I gotta fix that again."" Yes. So, it's a bit frustrating. Hello. Hi. My name's Michael. Michael. My name's Amanda. You have a very lovely bow. Thank you. And your hairstyle looks lovely as well. Thank you. And, so, tell me, what are your hobbies and interests? I like to collect toys and dolls and things. Seriously? Yep. That's what I like doing as well! Really? I've collected a lot of Thomas the Tank Engine... You like Thomas the Tank Engine? Yeah. I liked it when I was a kid. Yeah. I still like it a bit now. Yeah. Do you have a favorite Thomas character? No, there's too many of them. Yeah. So, how old are you? I'm 25. I'm 21. Have you had your birthday yet? Thank you. No, it's next week. Oh, so you're 22? Yeah, nearly. So, you were born in 1997. Same year Men In Black was released. Is that a movie? Mm-hmm. Yeah. You've heard of Asperger's? Yes. I actually have it. So do I. But mine's mild. So is mine. Wow. I was 13 when I got a diagnosis, so it was my first year of high school. I never knew I had Asperger's until my mother told me when I was 13. That's not too bad. Did she know when you were younger, though? I think so, but I don't know when. Yeah. When I was in primary school, I often sat alone. Yeah. Do you mind if I ask you something? Yeah? Um... I actually enjoy... enjoy talking to you. Me too. I'd like to catch up with you again sometime. You never know... What do you say? Nice. Hello. How's Cleo? What'd he say? How is Cleo? She's all right. She had a shed last night. Do you want me to show you the s-skin? Yeah. All right. Got a surprise for her planned. She doesn't know yet. It's the skin. Whoa. I'm very proud of my little girl. How do you feel about four years together? Yeah, it's cool. No need to sound so excited. Sorry, I'm just... quietly elated. You're a goose. It's like making out with Medusa. That's me. Hello, Thomas. Hello, Ruth. Hello. Congratulations on your fourth anniversary. What's going on? We're going on a date. Is that a Rolls-Royce with coach doors? This one's a vintage 1928 Chrysler. What did he say? It's a Chrysler, but we won't hold that against him. No, we won't. Thanks very much. My pleasure. Do you have a business card? I do. Thanks. Can I have one? You sure can. There you go. Brilliant! Thank you so much. My pleasure. Enjoy your evening. Cheers! What the...? Oh. Hmm. Yeah. Isn't this nice? It's very à la The Bachelor. But it's still very cute. Well... Well, very Bachelor, because it's entirely scripted. Where's my script? Didn't you get it? No! Who didn't email Ruth her script? Sorry, I forgot. I wish I saw the warning signs when I met you. I never professed to be a lady. Good. Oh, that hurts. Oh. You're a cutie patootie. And you have a cute patootie as well. Thanks. You're a really special girl, Ruth. You're very different and very unique. Well, you're a handsome boy. I am a handsome boy. You are. I'm a bit nervous, but excited. Hopefully it'll be love at first sight, or whatever. You know, like in the movies. Hi, are you Chloe? Oh, yeah, I'm Chloe. Are you Lotus? Yeah. Hi. Hi, nice to meet you. Hi. Would you like to sit down? Yes, please. So, um, what kind of stuff are you into, like, movies and stuff? Um, I sort of... I like Sailor Moon, you know, the anime. Oh! I love Sailor Moon.  Yeah. Me too. You do? I kind of stopped watching it for ages, and then got back into it. Oh, it's raining. Okay, I'm gonna put my jacket on. I'm just getting cold. Yeah. So are you, like, bi or lesbian? Yeah, I'm bisexual. I'm both. Okay. Yeah? I thought I was, like, a lesbian for the biggest time, because I didn't feel any attraction towards boys. Yeah. I started to think, maybe it was 'cause the boys at my school were gross. Um... So, are you on the spectrum, too? Yes. I didn't get diagnosed until I was, like, 12. 'Cause, you know, sometimes with girls on the spectrum... It's harder to... Yeah, you get diagnosed later. Hello. We've got a mixed berry smoothie. That's me, thank you. And the iced... And the iced choccy. Thank you. No worries. Yeah, it was kind of weird. When I was acting out, they didn't know what was wrong with me. They thought I was doing that because my parents got divorced. Oh. They were always like, ""The kid's just going through a phase."" Like, I had sensory problems, so I couldn't wear the socks, and I couldn't wear the sweater, and the school was like, ""Oh, she's just being annoying..."" Oh, yeah. Yeah, and... I was hated at my school, absolutely hated, because I would... No one knew, really, what to do. So, there's a sunflower farm, um, down the road. Would you like to go and pick sunflowers? Oh, yeah, sure. What's your favorite flower? Well, my name's Lotus, so... Oh, lotus. So probably a lotus. Yeah. I get it. So, which way's the sunflower park? Oh, down there. Alrighty. I wore the wrong shoes for this. Oh, so did I. Oh, God. Not to be lame, but this reminds me of Minecraft. Oh. Haha, yes, the autistic girl likes Minecraft. This is cool. Like a little hidden spot. Yeah. Feel that. Kinda hurts. Uh... I think it's going well. You know, a lot better than I expected. I really like her, you know. We're, um, talking, getting along. I was expecting, you know, sort of awkwardness, and that we wouldn't have anything to talk about and... Yeah, but we've just been non-stop talking. Got it, thank you. I think I got a little bit nervous, and I have trouble talking when I'm nervous, but I'm hoping that maybe she got that. I just hope she knows that's the case, and not that I was like, ""I don't wanna be here."" Do you see Chloe as someone you could potentially date? Yes. Yeah, um... Yeah, it'd be cool if she thought the same thing. That looks like a little love heart. Oh, it does! Yeah. Quite cute. Yeah. Are you... Are you all right? Oh, yeah, I'm good, sorry. I'm just spacing out. Um... Alrighty, um... Okay. Uh... Do you want this one? Oh, no, you can keep it. Really? Yeah. Okay, thank you. It's cute, I'll put it in my vase. Yeah. Um, well, my mum's here to pick me up. Uh... It was really nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you, too. It'd be cool to see you again. Oh, yeah. I would really like that. Oh, really? Okay, cool. Really, yeah. I was really worried, I didn't know if you liked me. I was... I was worried too, but that's really good. All right, um... Thank you. See ya! Bye! Goodbye. Bye. Are you happy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I can't stop smiling. Yeah. Can you describe for me the perfect relationship? Well, no relationship is perfect, because perfection in a relationship cannot exist in any way. But you can make a relationship a very healthy, stable, loving relationship. And whenever a person is feeling bored or unhappy in their relationship with someone, all they need to do is stop and do one thing that everyone should do: smell the flowers. They don't bloom every day. Wow, how good do you look? Million bucks. That's what I wanna hear. Jeez, I love your shoes, mate. Thanks, Dad. She'll be impressed. Yep. Speaking of which, this bit of paper that Adam gave me, I'll be keeping this on my person. What is it? Just dating points. Oh, okay. Dating advice. ""Be yourself, above all else. Remain focused on your date. Look for changes in the way she responds to indicate if she's interested in the conversation. If she gives you short responses with a flat tone, take this as a sign to change the topic. Keep your face relaxed while maintaining eye contact."" Adam's a smart boy. Indeed, he is. He gets it off me. Yes. Most guys wouldn't even think about all that sort of stuff. I wonder why. Because that's the way we've been created, I guess. Yes, but I want to be different from all men. In what way? An A-plus partner looks like me. I'm saying it because it's accurate, Mum. Yeah. Far-out, Mike. And... He's cute. ...when I do get married in the future, not only will my wife be my most crowning achievement, but also, I've actually envisioned a lot of family members in the future saying this... these words to my wife af... after my passing. What the hell? After your passing? ""Being your husband... nothing made that man any happier."" Mate... You're thinking too far ahead, mate. Dad, I always think ahead. Yeah, but that's a bit too far. Excuse me, everyone. I need to do my final preparations for the date. Okay. Thank you. So cute. Okay, which one? Ah-ha! Don't wanna be late! I know, I'm coming. Don't forget the rose. I won't forget that either, Mum. Okay. No problem. Don't forget your wallet. Nope. I never forget that, either. My... My hair comb. Um, just... Just bear with me for a couple of minutes. We'll be there, we'll be there! It's all right, Mike. Ready. Okay. Ready? Yep, ready. Good stuff. All right, well, all the best, Michael. Good luck. Thanks, Dad. Thank you. Take care, Dad. Good. Now get outta here. Yep, see ya, Dad. Nice flower, by the way, too. See ya. Remember your brother's advice. Got it! Got it. Ah, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Would you like some table water? Uh, yes please, thank... thank... Please and thank you. You all right? Just can't believe that this is happening. Little nervous."
Love On The Spectrum,01,02,"for years, ever since I left school. You all right? Little nervous. Just butterflies. She won't see it there. Hey! Hello, Amanda. How are you? Oh, please, allow me. Thank you. I'm... How have you been? I'm good. How are you? I'm very good as well. And, um... this is for you. Oh! I love flowers. You do? Yes. Thank you. It's my pleasure. You know, I used to study flowers. I never knew that. Yeah. Hmm. So, um, what's been happening? Been working. Yeah. Pretty sure. What have you been up to? Not a lot, just work as well. Yeah. Mmm. Okay. Mmm. Mmm. The last time we met, you said that you love cats, right? And you also said... Ah, thank you. It's all right. Thank you. And, so what other hobbies do you have? I've got birds I look after, and I like to do a thing called cosplay and go to conventions. Comic conventions? Yeah. I do too! Really? Yep. Yeah, have you been to one before? Yes, the Oz Comic-Con. I've been at that one. Have you been to any others? No, just that. Yeah? So, what else? Hmm. Might have to come back to that one... Uh... I wanted to ask you, when is your birthday again? I had it on Wednesday. Oh, I missed it. Yeah. When's yours? Twentieth of March. Same month as my cat's. Yeah. So, how many birds do you have? About 12... I think. I used to have more. Oh. So they flew away? Yep. Hmm. That must have been saddening. It's all right. You just learn from it. I suppose. Would you like to take a break? I'll be back, okay? Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Oops. Yeah. Is there anything we can do, Amanda, to help you feel better? I think it's too formal. I can't do this. It's just bad anxiety. Um, Cian? Cian? Hmm? Did I go too far? Too far? With... with the questions. No, I don't think so. Not at all. Oh. 'Cause... she seems a little bit quiet. Hmm. Um, here are your bag and your rose. Thank you. This doesn't have to be a date. Yeah. We can just, um... have a friendly dinner as friends? I think... wait, and I'll do another time. Yeah. Shall I s... see you to the... door? If you want to. Okay. Well, it was lovely seeing you again, Amanda. Mm-hmm. Sorry how things turned out. It's okay. I do feel bad. Don't feel bad. I just feel like I may have gone too far with the questions. Well, you take care of yourself, Amanda. You too. And good luck. Yeah. Oh, well. That's... That's life, I guess. Hi, I'm Maddi. I'm single, and I'm on the spectrum. I enjoy video games, books, and animals. How would you describe yourself, Maddi? I'm a very independent person. Reasonably smart. Uh, quirky. Always seem to, like, stand out a little bit without even trying. Or I'm funny without trying, people tell me, so... What's something you'd like people to know about you? That just because I'm on the spectrum, I'm not... I'm not... I'm not dumb. Some people can be really condescending, like, ""How... are... you?"" sort of thing. I'm like, please, come on. How do you know when you're in love? Um, I can't really say for sure, 'cause I've never really been in love, but I can only go by what... like, what I've seen in movies and things, so I'm not really... Can't get into that too well, sorry. Can you describe your ideal partner? Tall, muscular... rich. So, what do you guys think about me dating? I think it's great if you wanna date. Maybe you should date, get married, and move out of home. Move out of home being the important one. Ah... Well, how would you react if I brought a boy home? I think we'd cheer. I'd have to vet him. Make sure he was suitable for you. Make him very uncomfortable. Like we did with Montana, when she brought her boyfriend home. Right. What do you think? If I ever date, it'll be a couple of years before he meets you guys, at least. Years?! That's a bit rude. Protect the poor guy for a little while, for God's sake. Oh! Okay, well what about tonight? Let's talk about tonight. Who's going? So, superheroes disco tonight, down at Darling Harbour. And what are you going as tonight? Look for a Superman girl. Batgirl? Yes. Maybe we look for a Batman tonight. Okay, we're focusing a bit too much on tonight. Well, I think you gotta start somewhere, and maybe we start with tonight. What do you think are the qualities of a man that you'd like to date? Rich, muscular, tall. Eight-pack. Like your mother landed. Rich, muscular, tall. Mm-hmm. You need to lower your standards. You're not gonna get tall, muscular, eight-pack. You don't go to the gym. Where'd this eight-pack come from? It looks good. You don't go to the gym! I don't want someone flabby. Excuse you! You don't either. We were supposed to go to the gym today. I did go. There's no shame in being picky when it comes to love. What? Have I got this on backwards? Yep. These ones go down over your shoe. So, at the back, like... No, at the front, so turn it round. There should be an elastic thing... and socialize with her peers. Okay, pull it up. Yep. I would like to see her have somebody in her life. Clearly, I'm not gonna be here forever. It would give me some comfort to think that someone's there to look after her and she's there to look after somebody else. There we go. Wow, that looks cool. Where's the mask? Did you put it somewhere? No, I've got the mask here. Thank you. Do you ever worry that she will end up alone? Yeah, all the time. Mmm. All the time. That's good. Hello there. Ready to party. to bring people together You can't just dance with yourself, find people to dance with. Who do you know over here? This man here, you should be dancing with him. And he's tall... And a lot of money, he's Iron Man. If he's ugly, tell him to leave his helmet on. All right, I get... I get the point. I'll go talk to him. All right, guys. Whoa, hello. Would you like to dance? So, Sean, are you enjoying yourself tonight? Yes. Okay. How old are you, Sean? Twenty-eight. I'm 24. I'm 28. That's good. Tell me about yourself. What are some of your hobbies? Um... I'm trying to think. Hmm. Well, why... why don't I go first? My hobbies include video games... Yes. ...books, and animals. Yes. What about for you? What are some of your hobbies? Um, I'm trying to think. Do you like animals? Yes. Do you have any pets at home that live with you? Yes. Cat or a dog? I... I have a cat. Aww. I have a female cat named Marmalade. Is she a nice cat? Yes. Likes to play? Yes. Um... Should we head back inside, you think? Yes. Or would you like to stay out? Okay. Conga line! Conga line! Conga! Everybody in the conga line! Whoo! So, Kelvin... you just checking your hair? Looking good? Excellent. So, you're ready to start? I'm Kelvin. I'm 21. I have autism, a disability which helps me concentrate on one thing, rather than getting distracted by others. So, you think your autism helps you to really focus on one thing. How old were you when you were diagnosed with autism, Kelvin? Two years old. Wow, that's pretty young, hey. Do you think you're different to other people your age? Yes. How are you different? I have a different, uh, look in my face, and different personality from others. How would you describe yourself? I'm caring, smart, gentle, considerate, and professional. We'll share it, Dad. Yeah, maybe we can share. Yeah. This is so delicious. Mmm-mmm. Would you like to see Kelvin find a partner? Yes, definitely, yes. Being his father, yeah. Yeah, I'd really like to see if he can... uh, have... have a date, and then girlfriend, have a partner, and then, even better, to have a family. That's nice, isn't it? A bit hard, but, uh, hopefully, uh, there will be a day that, uh, this is possible. What's the hard part? What do you think will be difficult? I think it's the, like... uh, for him to communicate with somebody which is at the same wavelength. How did you feel when you heard that he was on the spectrum? Uh, devastating, but, uh, well, we have to come to terms, and we have to try our best, like, to help him. Yeah, that's what we did, like, all these years. Are you proud of him? Oh, definitely. I'm very proud of my son, yeah. Hopefully, one day, he will... He will find his partner.Yeah. Good to at least start with maybe a bit of practice. Hmm, yeah. Practicing what? Dad? Hmm? Practicing what? Uh, go out dating and seeing other, uh, people, and seeing ladies... Taking them out for dating, on dates? Yep, have dinner, go to the movies, yeah. Someone who is younger than you, Dad. Yes, of course, yes. For your dating, yes. What do you think love feels like? Love feels like when a man and woman get together, they'll make a perfect bond. Do you think it's harder for people with autism to find... a relationship, to find a partner? Some of them. Some girls don't feel like dating with someone in disa... with disabilities. What? What is it, Dad? It's me, Cian. Can we come in? Um, yes. This is a cute R2-D2 toy. Say hi, R2-D2. Beep-boop, beep-boop, beep-boop. And this is the poster of my year 12 formal. Did you take a date to the formal? I didn't. I want to show you the drawings that I made. This is Chibi Tsuyu. Eating frog cake. This is Suzuha Amane. She's strong-willed, athletic, like the one that I'm looking forward to dating. This is my original character, Yuko Ezo. She likes jellybeans, miso soup, mackerel, and carbonated drinks. So you made up that character? Yes. It's for my story. Where is your story? It's... Wow, that is incredible. You wrote all this? Yeah, I wrote it from my mind. I'll still keep on writing until I reach the end of this book. I think that'll take you a while. What...? Oh. T-That's enough. Excuse me. That's enough for now, okay? Enough filming? Yes. Thank you. We'll see you next time. Bye! Hello, Jodi. How are things? Things have been pretty good. Just work and that's about it. with somebody. About the date, it ended too early. My date got overwhelmed by the atmosphere. She had anxiety, and I was starting to get a bad vibe about things. I just told her that if she had to go, she was quite welcome to. That's really supportive. you were getting to know her? Yeah, I was. We both love cats. She loves comic conventions, and I do as well. I'm actually gonna be seeing her on Sunday. We'll be going to a comic convention together. with each other? Who knows? We might. you feel a little bit awkward Yeah. on the weekend. Yes, the Skipper off Gilligan's Island. Because... Because Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann on the show, will be there herself. She's pretty much the total package. She's not the hottest woman in the world, she's beautiful, but not extremely beautiful, but she's definitely polite, she's pure and very wholesome. That kind of woman is very hard to find. Which is unfortunate. Yes. Yeah. Yep. Will do. Likewise. Thank you for your time. All right, see ya. Take care of yourself. Would you say that you're different to other people? Well, yeah, 'cause I've got a disability, I'm on the spectrum, people are always gonna look at me as different from them, and I know I'm different from them, and that's fine, so... If we're all the same, the world would be pretty boring. Would you like to go out with a guy who is also on the spectrum? Yes. Some people like to choose partners who are the exact opposites of them. They've run out of things to talk about. How is that so? If you have lots in common, you wouldn't run out, it'd be endless conversations. So, I think... similar personality traits is quite good. for her very first date. Wow, you look great! Thank you, I know. You've got your special necklace on. Yes, it's a favorite. Your watch is even color-coded with your top, tonight. It's called ""successorizing."" Successoring? Success with accessories. Oh, I see. Oh, wow. Old people are so out of the loop, really. Excuse me! So, how are you feeling about tonight? Nervous. Your very first date. Yes. On Valentine's Day. I need a drink. You need a drink... You don't even drink! I don't care. Can I take a photo? No. No. Can I take a photo? No! Please, let me take a photo of you. No, come on. I don't need to be fussed... I'm not gonna fuss. Just one quick photo. Please. Do not put it on Facebook. No, I won't put it on Facebook. One... two... three. Okay. First date photo. Ooh! So excited! So excited! Please! Oh, God! No! God. Have a good night. I'm nervous. This is why I don't want you there. Okay. All right, all right. Leaving now. Have fun! That's important. Have fun. Bye! See ya. Right, that's it, huh? She's off. She's launched. Oh, my goodness. I wonder if all the coaching... I'm gonna be so nervous for her. Hello. Hi. Are you Maddi? Yes. I'm Mark. Nice to meet you. Mark, nice to meet you. Happy Valentine's Day. Thank you. I got these for you. Wow! Thank you. Great. And this... Thank you very much. They're lovely! Thank you very much. Right. Oh. It's nice to meet you. Lovely. Yeah. Okay. So, how's your day been so far? Oh, yeah, pretty good. Pretty good. Much better now that there's sweets. Oh, yes. I love sweets. Ah. How are you feeling? Uh... Not too bad, actually. Pretty... Pretty good. Slightly nervous. But what about you, how are you feeling? I feel good. Really confident and excited. That's good. Sorry to interrupt. Would you like to order food? For the main meal, I'll have the ravioli with ricotta and spinach. That would be nice. And I will take... the gnocchi, please. The gnocchi? Thank you. Okay. Thanks for that. Thank you. Enjoy your night. Thank you. We will, thank you. Okay. What is your favorite thing in the world? Dinosaurs. Oh, yeah? I'm into paleontology, stuff like that. Into what, sorry? Paleontology. How do you pronounce that? Pal... Paleontology. Paleontology. Sorry, I haven't heard of that one. That's okay. Paleontology. And that is? The study of prehistoric life. Oh! Yes. Cool, that's pretty cool. But I'm... Palen... Sorry. Palen... What is it? Pa-leon-to-lo-gy. Pa-leon... I'm sorry. No, it's all right, it's okay. Paleontology, okay. Yeah. How's yours? It was nice, it was really nice. I love ravi... ravioli. Mmm. You look beautiful. Very, very beautiful. Thank you, you look... you look quite nice your... yourself. Thank you. And that's a really beautiful necklace. You're very lucky to have that. It suits you well. Thank you. Thank you. I just wish this night didn't have to end. I can't remember when I've had this much fun. Yeah! It's been... certainly been... certainly been a very interesting evening, so... Well... Thank you. Thank you. Um... Maybe we should dine and dash, what do you reckon? Oh, no! No? You don't... don't like that idea? Subtotal... We could grab our stuff and run down the street. What... What... What did you order? The gnocchi. Shall we pay for ours separately or something? Uh... I've... I've got money, so, like... Would you like to split? How would you like it? Actually, um, I'll pay on this. Yeah. Rest on the card? Yes. Okay. Well, it's nice to meet you. It was nice to meet you, Mark. Thank you for... I hope we meet each other again. I had a great time, and I hope we can do this again. I had a good time too. It would be good to hang out... Yes. ...again, like... And I wish you all the best. Thank you. Thanks, once again. Thank you. See you. Have a wonderful night. Bye, Mark. Thank you very much for... You're welcome. ...the flowers. Thanks. You have a good night. You too. Bye. Bye-bye. See ya. How did the date go, Mark? Do you like Maddi? Oh, she's really nice and very sweet, and charming. I feel like she's the type of person that I'd love to spe... have spend my life with. Hi, sweetheart. Hey, Mum. How'd you go? Great. Did you have a lovely time? Oh, loved it. Lovely meal, and enjoyed the company? Oh, yes. Oh, she was spectacular. Beautiful? Oh, that's lovely, darling. She was a lovely woman. Yeah? That's awesome. Never had that much fun in one night. Can't remember the last time I ever felt this good. Oh, really? I'm so happy for you. So, how was tonight, Maddi? Yeah, it was a good night. I had fun. We had lots to talk about. He seems pretty smart, so, yeah. Yeah? Yeah, not many people interested in... paleontology. I think I've got that right. Hope that was right. Add the eight-pack, and that'll be perfection, so... Do you think you're a romantic person? I will be. How would you ask a girl on a date? If you liked someone, how would you ask them? Shall we go out for dinner together? Or should we have some... Shall we go out for a party... and dance to the music together? It'll be fun. has come to meet Kelvin Often when I meet people for the first time, I'm really checking to see what their ability is with initiating conversation. Sometimes I won't say hello to start with. I'll wait and see whether they can actually initiate verbally. Because sometimes people can't start a social interaction. Cool, it's you. Jodi? Hello. Hey there. Welcome. Thank you. Nice to meet you. My name's Kelvin. Nice to meet you, Kelvin. It's called the autism spectrum, because it's a spectrum. Come on, follow me. There is not two people on the spectrum where their autism presents in the same way. It is so diverse. And that's its beauty. It doesn't matter whether you're on the spectrum or not, everybody has a basic human right and a basic human need for connection and love. So... here's the girl. Why do you want to have this girlfriend? Because we... Because she's nice. What will you and the girlfriend do together? Together... we should go out on... a date. Yeah? What else do girlfriends and boyfriends do? Hug and kisses? Hugs and... yeah. Hugs and kisses. So, would you like to do hugs and kisses? Yes. Yes. When we go on our first date with somebody, what do we do on date number one? We should introduce her by name... first. What if the girl wants to sit down at the table? What would you... would be a good thing for you to do? Good thing... Like this, so you and I, I'm... I'm... I'm gonna come... Pretend Dad's not there, 'cause we don't want Dad on the date, do we? What? No way, Dad's not coming on the date. You show me what a gentleman would do if... if... Jodi's coming on... to meet you. Okay, you ready? Are you a gentleman? Hi. Here you go. Here's your seat. First of all, you have to introduce... Hi, my name's Kelvin Wong. Nice to meet you. My... My interests are manga and drawing and computer. Okay, first of all, you want Jodi to sit down, so we're on the same level. Don't we? Yes. Okay, so here's my chair here. Try again. Okay. Okay, you ready? Here I come... Hi, Jodi, my name is Kelvin Wong. Nice to meet you. Hello, Kelvin. My name's Jodi. Then the chair. Let her sit down. Uh... Here's your chair. No, go out and take the chair, and then... Go out and take... No. No, Kelvin. Stand up, get the chair out, and let the lady sit down. And then you say, here's your... Here's your chair, Jodi. Thank you very much. No, now you have to... That's a good... When... When the girl... She might already be sitting, but remember, before you move onto talking about yourself, we always do greetings first. Greeting. Greeting. Now, how... how are we going to start talking with the girl about... common interest? Common... Common inter... If you just start talking about... ""Hi, I'm really into computers, and I really like games and my iPad."" No! Okay. So the girls really like it... if people, boys, the first thing they do is ask them... A question. Perfect. Because then the girl thinks... ""Kelvin is really interested in me."" What would be a good first question that you could ask her? Ask her... What are your interests? Oh, nice one. What are your interests... Perfect! ...by the way. Perfect. So what about if she comes back and she says, ""I love animals and everything about animals."" Ooh. Cutie, indeed. And they are so cute like toys. They are like toys. What about... And then the girl might ask you a question... Do you like animals? I meant, I'm also interested in animals. We should go to the koala park. You're fine... Well, that was nice. Why were you suggesting that you go to the koala park? It's because she likes animals. I'm really proud. That is excellent. If she likes something that you don't like, is that okay? So, say she says, ""Oh, my favorite anime is... Yeah, uh, I used to... What if she goes, ""I like..."" I used to watch it, but not anymore. Not anymore. So is that okay that she likes different anime and manga than you? Yes, like, I get that Ouran High School is bad taste, and I shouldn't watch it, because of... 'cause it has mature themes. Okay. So, we started talking about anime. What did you do with your body? Uh... Looking away. You're looking away. And that's a no. Exactly. We've gotta keep the conversation being... Fifty-fifty. Fifty-fifty. So, if you turn away and start talking to yourself about your manga... It's not a good thing. It's not fifty-fifty, is it? I have to go to the bathroom. I'll be back. It's good that you come in and, like, show him all this. Like, it's very, very useful for him. Sometimes, like, man to man, it's difficult to get over to him. It's very hard. Do you know, I think this is stuff that... This is all the... the really simple things... Mmm. Um, that we forget are so important about social skills. Mmm-hmm, yes. But when you get to 21, almost 22, and he's desiring to have a relationship, it's very hard for a dad to do that. Yeah, yeah. Isn't it? I find it really hard for me to... Yeah. My job just is teaching people who are ready for... Um... ...dating and relationships. Yeah. And... Uh, for next one, I'll ask her what movie we're watching. Oh, have you been thinking about that? Oh, I... I was thinking. So, the most important thing about the first date is... Is the... Is, um... Greet her! Greet her. And what are you trying to find out? You're trying to find out... what you have in... What? In common. Perfect. You have to have some things that are the same... but you're allowed to have some things that are... Different. Perfect. I think your dating's gonna be good. Just remember, we go up the steps... slowly. Take it easy. Take it easy. I think for Kelvin, the challenge is just gonna be the beginning. Challenges of social skills with another person. He's at the really beginning journey of understanding what it is to be with another person and what that feels like, and has to go through all the things that we all go through. The rejection, finding out whether we've got a good match with somebody... At this stage in his learning, it's... it's about practicing. Just getting out there and giving it a go, and finding out who's a good match for him. Out you go, Jodi. I'll see you anytime. Okay, see you, Kelvin! See you! Hey, bud. Hey. How'd it go?! How'd it go?! Tell me all about it! Calm down. How did it go? Yeah, fine. He was a very nice guy. Really? What did he look like? Oh, you've got a photo? Yes, I do. Perfect! Oh, he's very nice. Yeah. Yeah... Are they the flowers that he brought you? Yeah. That was a nice touch, white roses. Yes, yes. What did you do when you got the roses? I said thank you and hugged him. You hugged him?! Yeah, like... Show me. Show me what you did. Just like that, sort of thing. Oh! I can do it properly standing up. Oh, that's a good thing. Don't make a fuss, honestly. No, everything was okay? All right, tell me all about him. What do you mean? Well, do you want to see him again? Yes. Perfect. I think he looks like he's good son-in-law material. Off you go, thanks. Off you go. Goodbye. Okay, all right. Parents, honestly... Jeez, Louise. Do you feel like you've got a lot of love to give? Yes. All the people I know and care about, they know me for my... for my large heart, which was once described as... ten sizes too large. Aha! There she is. Hello, Amanda. Hey! Good to see you again. Good to see you. What are you dressed up as? My character name's Riko. From what? An anime called Love Live! Ah. Yeah. Right. What's the book you've got? Oh, that's a cookbook. Is that part of your character? Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh. Actually, um... I wanted to see if I could get Dawn Wells to, um, autograph this. Okay. Is there anywhere you wanna go? Uh, yes. Um, you want to check out a few places? Okay. Do you know much about Dawn Wells? No... Barbara Eden? No. Barbara Feldon? No. Oh. Then you probably haven't seen No. Or Get Smart. No... Mmm-mmm. Ah. Oh, look, there's one with a costume right now! The genie? Yeah! Look! Look! I can see. That's her! Yep. That's the costume. If you ever wanted to have lunch or dinner somewhere, we don't have to... have to go somewhere formal. Okay. We can go somewhere casual. Yeah. Probably should've done that the first time. So, what do you wanna look at first? There is something I want to get. It's up this way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no. Everything okay? Don't you agree that that mask is creepy? Where? Right there, the guy with the dark hair. I refuse to watch those Halloween films. You don't like them? I hate 'em. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. They're too scary. A little bird tells me that you love plushes. I do. I've got lots of them. Yeah? Yep. I actually have a bit of an affinity for them myself. You like them too? I keep it secret, though. Oh.

I would be the kind of partner that is able to provide five things that every woman needs. Love, respect, happiness, support, and security. Oops. Uh-oh. Here's trouble. Oh, my goodness, who's that? Who's that? Hello? Hi, Mark, how are you? It's Maddi. Yeah, I'm doing pretty good. We've... I've recently adopted a new puppy. Yeah. He's a... He's a miniature schnauzer and his name is Arnold. Yeah. Ask him what he's been doing. Yes, a new best friend. Ask him... on a second date to Sydney next Friday? Next Friday. Yes, that would be... Yes, I would like... I would like to do another catch-up.

I'll see you later. You too. See you then. Bye! Wow! Okay. Such a pretty face. So, can't forget a pretty face! Whoo-hoo! Mmm! This is exactly why you guys are not coming. Maybe we should go and meet his parents. No! Make sure he comes from the right background. Right background. Sounds like it is. What? No. You're rushing things. No. Oh. Okay. How would you feel about having a partner and having love in your life? It would make me feel confident. I got pictures of girls in my brain, right now. They look cute. And they make me feel like I'm gonna love them. for a special night. Okay, you're all ready to go. Okay. Thanks, Dad. Just enjoy yourself tonight, huh? Just remember what Jodi said in the morning. Do a greeting with her. Yeah. And then introduce each other. Yeah. And then talk to each other about interests. That's right. Fifty-fifty. That's right. You don't need to say it. Just in your mind. Just remember it, yeah? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Looks like I'll be having fun tonight."
Love On The Spectrum,01,03,"What do you think love is? It can make people do crazy things that they wouldn't think of doing, make them act all bizarre. I think it requires, um, communication, honesty, and compromise. with his dinosaur knowledge. Hey, Maddi. Nice to see you again. Good to see you. Hey. How are you? Good, and you? Awesome.  Haven't been here in ages.  Well, you're gonna love it. Here we are, lo and behold, the dinosaur exhibit.  Ooh.  You know who these guys are? They're raptors. Raptors. You might remember them from movies like Jurassic Park or documentaries. Oh, I couldn't watch those movies. I tried to. It's just too much violence and gore. It's like, oh, my God.  Check out that toe claw.  Yeah, it's so long and sharp.  Yes. You could take someone's eye out. And it's very good for killing its prey with. How about that, eh? Yes.  This one's from Africa, Nigersaurus. That's a Hypsilophodon. It's a cute little dinosaur. Sure.   When they discovered the Sinornithosaurus, it sent shock waves throughout the paleontological community. This is Maiasaura. The name Maiasaura means ""good mother."" Well, there you go. Yeah. This is the femur of the sauropod dinosaurs. Some of them are so big, you can't even wrap your arms around them. Here's my old favorite, Stegosaurus.  Stegosaurus. Minmi. Minmi? Yeah. It's an Ankylosaurus. Here's a really cool dinosaur. Cryolophosaurus. Oh.  Interesting fact. Tyrannosaurus Rex has the strongest, the most powerful bite of any other dinosaur.  Yeah. Truly a formidable predator.  Is it going well so far? Oh, yeah. I've hardly been... I haven't been... I haven't been able to get much, um, sentences in, because he's always just, like, saying something. But that's okay, like... It's fine, so... Ah, perfect.  That was love. Ah, this is perfect. Yeah, fabulous.  Such a beautiful place.  Yeah. Nice.  Just feel that breeze. It's like Mother Nature is giving you a nice welcoming kiss. Hadn't thought about it like that.  One day, um, Ma... Um, Maddi, one day, if you found the perfect guy, would you like to get married? Um... Well... Maybe, I think... I think that's kind of a question... when... when I find that someone... Yeah. ...and kinda if. Do you feel anything about me? Um...  I know... Oh, jeez. Um... Yeah. Oh, look... I think you're a very nice guy, very smart, and very interesting. Yeah. And very good friend material. Yeah. I just... There's no romantic feelings, like... That happens a lot. But, uh, I think you're beautiful. You're smart as well. Oh, thank you. And you... you're very enthusiastic. I think you have excellent friend material. There's nothing wrong with being friends. Yeah, yeah. You know... At least I made a new friend. Yes, yes. That's the wonderful gift of life. Yeah.  Well... Okay. It's been a wonderful day. Yeah, it has been quite an experience. I wish you all the best. Thank you. I hope you take care of yourself. I wish you all the best for the future. You too. All right. You as well. Okay. Well, goodbye. Bye.  I've never had romantic feelings for anyone. And I'm not sure, like... if it hasn't happened by now, it might not happen, you know? So, like... Like, maybe it will happen if I meet the right person, but, like... And because I never experienced it, maybe I don't know how to read the signs, or... pick up the emotions, or whatever. Hey, Mark. Hey, Dad. Great, we had a wonderful time. Great? Well done. Good on ya, fella. So, what happened? Well, we... we're not really... compatible. Oh, okay. That's fine. We always said that might be the case. Yeah. Well, to be honest, I feel a little bit sad. Yeah, I understand. And so, you left on a good note, though? Yeah. A happy note? We're both friends, so... Right. That's all we can... That's all we can ask for. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Ready to go home? Yeah. It's been a long day. Yeah. Okey-doke, let's go. All right, shall we check this place out? Oh, it's amazing. in his search for love. for some dating advice.  Good thing this table's free. Yeah, this is the best one in the place. What's going on in your life at the moment? You've been searching for dates? Yeah. Maddi was a nice person. But... unfortunately, we didn't have any romantic spark between us. Oh, man. We were more keen to friends. That's me. Thank you. You're welcome. Cheers for that. That is interesting. Ah, yes, nothing like a nice cup of tea on a wonderful afternoon like this. That's true. And that banana smoothie looks really nice, I've got to admit.  So, what do you think girls like? Humor. Oh, yes, yes, yes. And I do think, to get a girl to like you, is to flatter them. Oh, yes, definitely. Because they have feelings just like we do. Would you prefer a girl who has the same interest in dinosaurs? That would be wonderful. Yeah.  It's a huge world. Anything is possible. I mean, I like dinosaurs too, but not an obsession. Well, I'm madly in love. I'm sure you are.  Yeah.  Mmm. Are you, uh, dating anyone? Not officially. Okay, right. Yeah. I'm still looking. Well, stay strong. You know, someone will come along and... will be right for you. Yes, my soul mate is out there, I just haven't found her yet. Yeah. It will happen. It will happen. It will happen. Yep. Are you on any dating sites, like Plenty of Fish or eharmony? Oh, yes, I've looked into dating sites. Even int... Yeah? Even international dating sites. International dating sites, interesting. I could picture myself with a, uh, Mexican girl on my right shoulder and a Russian girl on my left shoulder.   Yeah... I guess I'm the international lover kind of guy. Ah, okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that was great... Oh, sure. ...having time with you. Thanks. I had a wonderful time, and I hope we do this again. Oh, sure, my pleasure. You take care, Ryan. Pleasure, as always. Wish you all the best.  Thanks, you too. Have a good day. Good luck with your search.  I will. You too. Thanks.  See ya, Ryan.  See ya, Mark. Take care.  How do you feel about being on the autism spectrum? I have mixed emotions, you know. Even though I'm on the spectrum, I'm still capable of falling in love and being a compassionate and caring person.  And have you ever had a relationship? No.  So, falling in love is something you would like to do? Oh. For a long time, yes. It's always been on my mind, and it's just so hard to get. This is a skull of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, I'm very proud of it, you know. I basically worship it. This is by a paleo artist. This guy here is a grade A, bona fide dinosaur. It has a small sail on its back. In the mating season, you would want to show that off and say, ""Hey, baby, look at me. I'm the one you want to mate with.""  Can you describe for me your ideal partner? I like a girl who is very passionate, at the same time, a very... calm and caring nature.  What if she hates dinosaurs? No deal. Hey, Dad. Hey, Mark. How was work? It's been a busy day.  I bet. Hey, Mum. Yeah, I sure did. Good boy. I'm looking forward to Matt's wedding. Have we heard any more from Matt and Emma? I think in a few weeks, you'll be going on the bucks night. Yeah, that would be fun. Yeah.  Is your brother getting married? Mm-hmm. would you like to do that one day? Yeah. You can find the girl of your dreams. I think you'd make a great boyfriend. You're a beautiful person. Yeah. We're just amazed at how far he's come. It... I mean, it's been a hell of a long journey. Mark, in his young age, he had limited language, meltdowns, he was destructive. A lot of our friends who had children with autism, um, their marriages broke down, and, uh, ours was strained too. And so, I think I need people to know that you do need to work together, and you have to work hard, and I think that it's now paying dividends. Sorry.  because it has been a hard road, but we've seen light at the end of the tunnel. And we've seen Mark just come so far.  How would you describe your ideal girlfriend? Clever, intelligent, energetic, athletic, strong... brave, grateful. And she smells good.  She smells good. And perhaps has a... smell of orange juice, or... um... or... flowers.  That sounds good. Good to see you. I'm having Teppanyaki here for dinner with my date. All right, okay, just take a seat.  Nobody likes a dumb-dumb man. Don't be a dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb- dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb...  There she is. My name's Kelvin Wong. Hi, Kelvin. Nice to meet you. What's your name?  I'm Jessica. Nice to meet you. Here... Please sit down.  Thanks, man. Wait, that's...  Mmm, hmm. You smell good. Yeah, it does. Okay. All right. What are your interests? Oh, uh, I like video games and, uh, computer. I actually brought my Switch today, if you want to play Smash. Um... When? No, as in, while we wait for the server to come over. I hate waiting. You hate waiting? What, wait, um... I am... I am waiting patiently. Um, okay. Damn, this is... What about anime? Or manga? Oh, I don't really... read or watch much anime, but I do prefer video games. I'm just gonna switch this on for you. Oh, excuse me, any... you like movies? Oh, uh, I do like to go see movies from time to time. So... do you like animals? Oh, I... I like animals. Ooh. All right, just hold your controller sideways like this. All right. Thank you. And do you like cooking? Uh, no, I'm not a huge fan of cooking. Wait a minute... Ah... I know how to do... what? What? I lose.   Well...  Aw. Oh, you... I guess you're not very good at this game, huh? You can't really rejoin. Sorry about that. Sorry, it's a shame. Shame, it's... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I thought it'd be good to entertain ourselves. What? I thought it'd be good for us to entertain ourselves. What?  Hello. Hello, how are you?  Okay. All right. some prawn...  Ooh. ...fish, chicken... beef, and fried rice. All right! Yummy! So, now I cook the seafood first. Ooh, fish! Ooh. Cutting up prawn. I did read that you had to cut out the head from the prawn when you cook them. Didn't think you'd have to cut out the guts, too. Ooh.  Ooh! Ah, wow. You're so smart! All right, please try prawn first. Thank you.  I will burn myself. Yeah, what he said. Bon appétit. Yummy. Mmm. Not half bad.  Fire? Ready? One, two, three, go!  Oh! Hoo, Jesus Christ! It is a fire. Fire, yeah. Kelvin, you've been speaking a lot of Japanese. Yes, I've been speaking Japanese for three years. all right? Can you catch your bowl first? Two hands. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. One, two, three... Catch! Good, yes. Oh, I-I learned it from my teacher, Travis-san. Ah, nice! Every Wednesday or Friday. Yes. Two hands on the bowl. Good. Yes. Yes. All right, ready? Catch, all right? One, two, three... Catch! Good. All right. Yeah.  Thank you. How do you make eating with chopsticks so easy? I'm a Chinese boy. And I come from a Chinese family. Oh. But I was born here in Australia.  I hope you don't mind me making a mess. I'm just trying to get used to these. How do you make them work so well for you, Kelvin? What is it? What is it you're talking about? The chopsticks. The chopsticks, oh. Copy me. No, not like that. Oh, yeah. Use your thumb in front of the chopsticks, only the thumb.  Oh.  Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, thank you.  Oh... Um... You're welcome. So... Do you like koalas? I do like 'em. And one day, would you like to go to the koala park with me? I would like... I actually would like that. How about Taronga Zoo? Where, Taronga Zoo?  Mm-hmm. That's a... It's in Mosman.  Have you seen the ambulance out there? What are they doing? I don't know, but it can't be good. I just hope they aren't coming in here, though. Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom, please. Can I go to bathroom, please? I'll be right back. Oh, okay.  Thank you. Be back.  What do you think of Kelvin, Jess? He's actually pretty nice, if you ask me. But he often had issues trying to understand me, and vice versa. Maybe it's because I'm not good at rolling my... R's, I can't do it. Cian, uh, Jessica's a very nice girl to me. She likes video games, movies, and traveling. And... But she doesn't like anime.  That's not true. Or manga. I actually do like anime, I just like video games more.  Why don't you go join her again and we can talk later, okay?  Okay. Anything you like most, other than video games? Oh, I like using the computer. Using the ""competter""? Yeah. What? Using the ""competter""? ""Competter""? The computer? I'm sorry, I don't want to be racist or anything. What, what? As in, you know, you said ""competter."" What? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not trying to be mean or anything, but... Competter? I'm sorry, but I meant computer. You know, laptop? The laptop. PC? Like my daddy uses. At home. Oh, heads up. All right, ice cream. Oh, caramel. Enjoy. Damn, that is good ice cream. You like yours?  Mmm, I like this. It was great going out on our first date together. Yeah, but don't automatically think we're gonna start kissing right now. Oh, oh, fine. Like, you're a great guy and all, but... I'm not ready to fall in love yet. You don't think I'm a g... You don't think I'm a great guy? No, I don't think... I don't think... You're not a bad person or anything. You don't feel like loving me? You know what? You're actually a great person. I'd actually like to hang out with you more as a friend. Not in the romantic way, just in the... platonic way. Platonic? Yeah. So, can I... add you to my contacts? Okay. And what's your phone number?  I'll just show it to you. Oh, that's fine.  Just type this. So, it's been a great time going on a date together. Yes. Hopefully, I'll get to catch up with you sometime soon enough. Okay, see you! Bye, Kelvin! Bye, bye!  Like, he's a really nice guy. I bet he'll find someone who loves him for who he is. But he kind of sucks at video games. She doesn't like manga or anime so much, but she likes video gaming more than that. It's better to be friends than being an official girlfriend.  What does love mean for you, Maddi? Well... love should mean that you stand by the person you're in love with, through thick and thin, and you don't bail... just 'cause you're bored. And it means, like, supporting them, and not just... not just turning a blind eye to when they clearly need help, so...  When are you happiest? With family. Family is like, um, brownies. They're a really sweet bunch, but you can't avoid getting a few nuts. Right!  Are we ready to get ready for the date? Yes, let's go get ready. Here are the pants. Uh-huh. Good.  Here's the shirt. Remembering that that goes to the back. Yes. People on the spectrum, they don't read the social cues that we all read. They get a lot of their social cues off television. And it was very early on I realized that I had to be the one she was getting her social cues off. Hey. How's it going? Oh! Oh, come around. Show me, show me, show me, show me, show me. Oh, that's good. Okay, how you feeling about it all? A tad nervous, but...  Do you wanna go through a rehearsal? Yeah, good idea. Steve, you're the barman. What are you gonna do when you meet him? Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Maddi. Oh, hi, Mad... Maddi, you don't need to... What? That's very hard. You've got a weak handshake 'cause you're old. Okay. Lovely to meet you, Maddi. Can I get you a drink? A lemonade, please. Lemonade. A lemonade, too. Thank you, barman. Two lemonades. So, you look lovely. Oh, thank you, you look decent as well. You look decent?   It depends on what his outfit looks like. What do you do for a living? I'm a jewelry designer. Yes. That job must rock. That's a good one! That's a good one! Your table is ready. Thank you. Maddison, would you like to go to dinner? Yes. Sit there, I'll sit over here with Steve. So, the idea is to keep the conversation flowing. Do you have any siblings? Uh, I have two sisters and two brothers. What about you? Two brothers and two sisters. And I have six nephews and lots of nieces. So, that's a lot of nieces and nephews... Do you want children of your own? No, never. When you're answer is no, you leave nowhere for the person to go. Because what you're trying to do is keep the conversation going. Let's try again. Do you want children of your own? No, because I think they're a waste of time and money. Good lord.  I don't know. What is that smile? Am I not allowed to smile?  No, people like smiles. Just be yourself, gorgeous. Just relax. You're telling me to keep the conversation going, but telling me not to tell people what they wanna hear, so I don't know how to combine those two. You can. You can still be honest, and... and say, ""Look, I don't think I'm ready for children. I may never be ready for children."" It just leaves it open. ""I may never""? I don't want to, like, put any maybe in there, in case he, like... I give him false hope. I don't want to, like, not prepare for it, and it comes up and I don't know what to do, so... cover everything. The chances of something coming up that we haven't covered is pretty high. We're gonna need to sit here for ages, then. No, we're not.  Yes, we are. You can't send me out there without being prepared. It is meant to be fun. Yeah, it is. Okay. So exciting, huh? Yes.   Are you a romantic person, Mark? Yes. Absolutely. And I just want to share my life with someone very special, and just show her the person that I really am, and to show her that my disability is not an obstacle, that I'm capable of falling in love.  If you do find love, how do you think you'd know? I feel like my heart skips a beat. My smile begins to beam. I just feel... entranced. set up for people on the spectrum.  The social club is about people with disabilities coming together, making friends, and having fun, which is very important, not just to me, but to everyone else that has a disability. Hi Mark, you came. Gonna sign up and play? Okay, cool. Yeah. How about you, Christina? You good?  I'm all right. You ready to have some fun tonight, guys? Oh, yes. Oh... no, no, no! What do you... What do you think about the new girls here? Yeah, they're nice. They're nice. I might like to talk to them a bit more later on. You know, get to know them better. So, how's your night been so far? You enjoying yourself? Yeah! Yeah, it's cool. I haven't bowled in ages, but... Yeah. So, do you have any family? Um... Well, yes, I have family. It's just me and my mum at home. Okay, I have a brother and a sister, and I have a mum and dad at home right now. And, uh, my sister will be... expecting soon in May. Oh, wow. I... I don't really care if it's a boy or a girl... ...as long as we're getting a new little... little baby child. Well, that's certainly happening. Yes. Oh. Ready to go. Righto.  Good luck, Presley. Thank... Oh, thank you.  We'll... We'll see.  Yes! Um, Presley? Yes? What are your interests in? I'm keen to know, what do you like? Um, I like to draw. Oh, that's great. Yeah, I really enjoy that. I like drawing nature and, like, animals and stuff. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah. Very beautiful. What do you like to do? Play video games, watch movies, read books. Yeah. What movies are you into? Which ones are you into? Um...  Well...  Um, just... Uh, well... Just... Sorry, I'm... blanking out. Hang on, sorry. Excuse me for a second. That's okay. You all right?  Oh, God. Sorry. I just blanked out from nervousness. and just don't know what to say. Couldn't talk. Just... just... just be yourself, man. Just... just... And just... ask your questions, you know? Just build on those conversations. Right. Just breathe.  Come on. Hi, are you Severin? Hey. Yeah. Maddi, nice to meet you. You're Maddi. Yep. Well, you know, how was your day, I guess. Oh, yeah, pretty good. Pretty good, just catching up on... chores, errands, bits and pieces, so... Yeah. And your... how was your day? Um... Let's see... Well, um... had an appointment earlier, and... other than that, um... sprucing up a bit.  Ah. 'Cause, um... Well, yeah. Uh, so... Yeah... So, um... What do you like to do for fun? Oh. Uh, I... I love video games. I'm a huge video game nerd, so...  Nice, same. What kind of games do you play? I play The Sims 4. That's a great game. Yep. I'm the ruler.  Nice.  Yeah. Um... So... Yeah, um... Um...  Yeah. Um... So, um... Goodness me, listen to that noise. Wow. Screaming kids, that is horrible noise. It's like, be quiet. Um...  Thank God it stopped. Like, do you think you'd ever want kids one day? Like... Oh, it's... It's funny for me. Like, if you asked me maybe a year ago, I'd be like, ""No, I never want children, ever! Ever, ever!"" Like, that's what I was like, but I think as I've gotten older, like, I... Changed your mind a bit? Like, I've become more open to the idea. I don't really know if I'd ever want kids. I... I'm open to the idea, like, eventually if I was to find, like, the right person... Hmm, but yeah. Yeah, being open-minded, so... Yeah. Crumbs, I was afraid this would happen. It's starting to fall apart. Oh, whoa.  Oh.  Yeah. Ah... Oh.  Oh, yeah. Yeah?  Yeah. All good?  No worries. How was everything? Delicious, thank you.  Yeah, pretty good. Great. All good. Um... May I ask, what do you potentially think you want to do as a career one day? I think something with... something with animals. I did an animal studies course at TAFE.  Okay. Now I'm doing Cert III Music Industry at TAFE. The piano... Oh. ...specifically. Nice.  Um... Absolutely love piano with great burning passion, so... When I was in high school, and I heard a guy playing, I... I think it was actually the Skyrim theme on piano, Oh, wow. That's what sparked a bit of interest. And then I started, like, self-teaching myself. Wow. And um... yeah. I do have a surprise for you. Oh.  'Cause, did you know, there's a piano they have right here. Oh, my goodness. I didn't notice that on the way in, no.  Yeah. You like Skyrim, right? Yeah... Oh, I recognize that. Wow, like...  A bit improvisation, a bit... actual Skyrim.  Uh... Seriously, you are really good at that. Yeah. Did you have lessons when you were younger, or like...? No, I've... All self-taught? I've self... Well, pretty much, yeah. I've self-taught since I was 18. That's very impressive for self-taught then. Oh, man. Y-You all right?  Yeah. Uh, um...  So, yeah... Is it the first date where you said they played Skyrim for you on the piano? Yeah, it's the first time anyone's done that for me. So, thank you very much. Very accurate. But yeah, um...  All right. Well... Well, I had a good evening, Severin. Thank you for coming out here and doing this. Nice to get to know you. Yeah, nice to get to know you, too. Um... Yeah. So, uh, you know... Do, like... Uh... Do you want to do this again sometime or... Yeah, it's a good... It's a good idea. We should... We should do this again. Fair enough, um... Okay, um... Yeah, I'll call you then. All right. It was nice meeting you. Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming out, and... Yep.  That's everything, so... Bye. Have a great night. You too, bye.  Yep. See ya, have a great one. She seems fairly geeky as well, which is, you know, my type. You know, I like someone who's a bit nerdy, like me. I think there may be potential there for something great.  Hey, Maddi. Hey, how are you guys?  Good! How was your date? Oh, yeah, really good. He was very... Severin was a very interesting guy.  Yeah? Cool! He played piano for... for me at the... at the restaurant. At the pub, so...   Oh, my Lord! Was he very good? Oh, he is really good. You know that game I play, Skyrim?  Yeah. He played me a music track on there which I recognize. I was like, ""Wow, how accurate!""  Oh, wow, so you obviously had Suppose so.  Excellent. That sounds like Yeah.  Okay, all right. Well, then, uh, Bye, guys. See you later. Bye.  They sound happy. Yeah. They always insist on being part of my life, so...  As parents do, I suppose. Yeah.  What do you think's the biggest challenge you've had to overcome? Um...  Trying to work on my social skills, and... trying to... you know... see how the real world works, and stuff like that. It's been a huge challenge. Can't wait for today's activities. It's a good opportunity, too, darling. Oh, yes. in his search for love. Have a great day. Well, you too. Hope you learn a lot... I will. And get a lot out of today. See ya, Dad. See ya, mate. for people on the autism spectrum, One of the biggest misconceptions that I've found about people on the spectrum is that they're perfectly happy not being social, not dating, and that just really is very rarely true. You guys excited for today?  For years, my phone has just been ringing off the hook from adults and their family members, um, desperate to learn how to develop romantic relationships. So that's where we come in with our dating boot camps, is to try to teach the skills that many people sort of take for granted and use naturally in dating situations. Dating is a choice, right? Do we get to date everybody? No. No. Does everyone get to date us? No. What could be the problem with choosing someone who's maybe not so nice? They could be doing drugs or alcohol.  Yeah. They could be part of a gang or...  Yeah. Would that be a good choice in someone to date? No. So we're all clear, there's good choices and bad choices when it comes to dating, right? When we're on a date, we have to be able to make conversation with people. Remember, we're supposed to trade information. Well, there's lots of rules about trading information. So one of the things you do is you're gonna ask questions, right? Because what is the goal, what are you trying to find? Exactly. And so, in order to find common interests, you have to share things about yourself as well. Yes.  Okay, we're gonna see a few role-plays about what not to do. So I want you guys to watch this role-play, and I want you to notice what Nathan is doing wrong in trying to trade information. -So, Lizzie, what'd you do on the weekend? I just went to the beach. Oh, cool, which beach? Uh, Bronte. Oh, did you go with your friends? Yeah, a couple friends. Did you go swimming or surfing? Uh, swimming. Oh, do you build sandcastles?  Do you play beach volleyball?  All right, timeout. So what did Nathan do wrong, Joseph? Um, ask too many questions. He was being an interviewer, right? It's not a reciprocal conversation, so they're not finding common interests. It has to go back and forth. Okay, watch this next role-play. Think about what Nathan is doing wrong this time. So, Lizzie, who was the last person you dated?  Uh... Jason. Did you love him?  Uh... Yeah.  What about me? Do you love me? Uh, sorry. Could we order dinner first? When are we gonna go on our honeymoon?  I'm just not... Sorry.  When should we get married?  Okay, timeout. So what did Nathan do wrong? A little bit too personal. He was getting too personal. Yeah, what else? Mark? It was like this. He put the hammer down too soon, you know? Got right into it way too quickly. Yeah, right, kinda came on way too strong. Joseph? Was being a bit too imposing and getting down her throat a bit. Yeah, exactly. All right, guys. Well, now that we know how to trade information and hopefully make conversations during dates, we're gonna practice this. So, who wants to go first? Okay, Mark, wonderful. Come on up to the front of the room here with Lizzie. We're gonna imagine that you're on a date with Lizzie, and you're just making conversation.  Yeah. And what will your goal be in this conversation? To find common interests.  Very good. All right. So, what do you like to get up to on weekends? I kinda like playing tennis and things like that. Oh, yes. Swimming, yeah... Well, my mum plays tennis. Oh cool, nice. She used to be in the... the league, but... She doesn't anymore. You know, so she just does it in her spare time. Yeah. That sounds fun. Have you tried it? I have, but I'm a little bit sloppy at it. Keep missing it, it's just... I just... Um, just... Um, just trying to think... Sorry, I'm... Oh. So, don't worry about that. You're doing a fantastic job. But think about questions that you might ask the other person... Oh, yes. ...to sort of get out their interests. And then you're doing a good job of sharing about yourself, but always making sure you're also checking in with Lizzie. Question, do you ever find it difficult to sort of come up with new topics to talk about? Yes.  Yeah. Does... Does that happen to other people too?  Yeah. So, you know what? This is a great opportunity for all of us as a group to maybe brainstorm what are some common topics that people talk about on dates? Family, exactly. What else? Holidays?  Holidays!  A lot of people think that social skills are abstract, but in reality, we're all naturally following concrete rules and steps, and so it's really critical that we outline what these steps are for our young adults. What else do you like to do? Go hiking, or to the beach, or see my friends... What about you? Well... to go hiking as well. I love to get out in nature.  You do? Yeah, it's so much fun. It makes me feel peace whenever I'm in nature. Wouldn't you agree? Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree. Yeah. I got lost last time I went. Oh. Well, I know my way around the forest. Oh, that's good, yeah.  It's a very good skill to have. Yeah. Yeah. I think Mark did a great job. What do you guys think? I think he did awesome. Shall we give him a round of applause? Yes. Thank you.  That was fantastic.  Well done, Mark. Thank you, thanks. Thank you. Okay, well, it's just been such a pleasure working with all of you. I'm so, so, proud of all of the... the progress I just saw in one day. I just want to wish you all the best of luck in dating. You know, dating can be hard, for anybody. But now you guys have all the tools that you need, and it'll be a whole new experience for you moving forward. I wish you guys the very, very best of luck, and a big round of applause to all of you. Congratulations... ...on completing our boot camp. Can you feel those? Do you think they look cold enough? Perfect, yeah. for a date at the zoo.  What are your hopes for today? I hope we enjoy each other's company and we have a good time. Yeah. Just be your adorable, beautiful self. And... pay attention to what she's interested in. Tell here about yourself. I will. Sometimes girls like to talk about themselves, too... Yeah. ...a little bit. I know. I know. I've got one tip for you, Mark. You know how you've been going to the gym? You want her to see your muscles, so this is how you do it, just like... You go like this, and you go, ""Do you see the pelicans over there?"" And let her see it, okay? What do you think of that? She'll be impressed. What do you think of that tip? I know, I know. Just let me handle it my way. Yeah, thanks, Dad. Yes. Yeah, thanks.... Thanks. So happy for him. Ah, it'll be great, won't it? Bye, sweet."
Love On The Spectrum,01,04,"I'm just... I'm just worried because I can't see your face. I think that glass on the angle... yeah.  How is it? Better? Uh, no, I think you made it a bit worse. I think... Whoo, I... Yeah, that's perfect.  Yeah? Yep. My name is Andrew. I'm 27 years old. I work at Family and Community Services in Newcastle. And I want to find a girlfriend for some love.  How would you describe yourself? Polite, on time, uh, cute... organized, as well... f-f-f-funny.  How are you funny? Uh... Like, sometimes I tend to, um... make some f-funny jokes, or different voices, as well.  What sort of voices do you do? Let me think, um... My name is Bond. James Bond.  Which Bond was that? Uh, I think that was Sean Connery. But, yeah, I'm still getting, like, used to it. Like, with the voice, making it a bit deeper and that.  How important would you say it is to you to find someone special? I think, to me, it will be very important to find someone, uh, for love.  What would you rate it, on a scale of one to ten, how important? I think ten, actually.  So, this is actually my bedroom. This is my number one bear, Angus. Most of the time, he normally sits with me. So, this is Ernie. He's been my second favorite bear. I actually got him when I was about six or seven years old, from Santa. And, um also, the Crocodile Dundee hat, actually. That's not a knife... this is a knife. So, this is my hobby room. It'll give you a bit more idea who I am and that, so... A set of a jigsaw puzzles here. Most of these old ships here are very, uh, collective and, uh, fragile. Here is a collection of my, uh, K'NEX. So, this is a six-foot clock tower which I built. It moves, as well. So, this is a six-foot, uh, Ferris wheel that I'm building at the moment, which is, um, nearly complete.  Do you think being on the autism spectrum kind of has something to do with you having these kind of strong interests in things? I think so, yes.  Sounds like you like to follow the rules. Yes. Yeah, rules and procedures, I'm very strict on those.  Get yourself plenty of ice. That much will be fine. My favorite drink is a Sex on the Beach.  And that's a cocktail? Yes.  Thirty mils of the peach schnapps, then 30 mils of, um, the vodka, Just stop for a second. I've made this wrong. It was supposed to go in this first.  Oh, no!  Try again. Thirty mils of the peach schnapps, in there... there we go. You will need 90 mils orange juice. Shake it without the ice for about ten seconds... And that's how you make a Sex on the Beach. Ahh. Perfection.  Have you ever kissed anyone, Mark? Like, a girl? No. Never.  Something you would like to do? Oh, yes. I mean, that would... be quite an experience. A very huge experience for me. I can't wait to see what she's like. Yeah, I really am excited and feel really good. Hello. Nice to meet you, I'm Mark. Hi, I'm Lauren. Nice to meet you, Lauren. Hi! Sorry. I wanted to wave, but, like, with my crutches... Oh, no, that's... that's... that's perfectly all right. That's... That's nothing to worry about. Yeah. How are you? I'm good, thanks. How are you? Looking... I'm... great. I'm really excited to this. Yeah, it's so cool.  So... So... Shall we go in? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Just take your time. Yeah, thanks. You know, don't want to rush you.  No. It's all right. So have you visited any places on Earth? I've only had, like, one major... um, overseas holiday. That was last year. Yeah. So, um, my aunt, who lives in China... Oh, okay. Yeah, she was getting married over there.  I've always wanted to go to China. Let me tell you a bit about myself.  Yeah. My favorite animals of all time are dinosaurs. When I saw Jurassic Park, it changed my life, and...  Oh really? Yeah. Okay, that's interesting. I read all sorts of books on dinosaurs... Yeah? ...and paleontology, and it... Okay, cool. And I even... Like Ross, in Friends.  I also love birds, since birds are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. That's true, yeah. Oh, that's so cute. Aww. It's very sad there's not many left of them.  Yeah, and sadly, some of them have been hunted into extinction by poachers.  Hmm.  During the Ice Age, the mammoths and the mastodons were hunted for their meat. Oh, yeah. You know? You would think that we would have learned our lessons, but... Yeah. ...the tragedy is, we're still doing... horrible stuff to these beautiful, intelligent animals that have the right to live peacefully on our planet. I don't know if you've heard, but they have good memories. Ah, yes! Yes, that's right.  Yeah. I think... I have no short-term memory. I have to see people quite a few times before I remember them.  Oh, okay. Right. So... I'm thinking I should hire an elephant, I'll teach it to talk... Yeah.  ...and then, it can just follow me around, and it can be my personal memory keeper.  This is the cassowaries.  They're such pretty animals.  Yeah, they're very beautiful, but they have a really nasty attitude. They've actually killed people. I mean, you see that? Really? Those feet look like very useful for disemboweling its victims. Put it this way, they're the closest as we can get to a raptor dinosaur. Oh.  Oh, that's a weird noise. That's not a good noise. Is it gonna start charging? I think it's best just to leave them. Yeah, we'll move on. See you, guys. See ya. Oh, she's a very wonderful, charming girl. She loves animals, and... really, I'm impressed by her enthusiasm and her admiration and respect.  Do you think there's any romance in the air? That's a bit up in the air at the moment. I can't say for sure. But, you know, we'll just have to wait to see if that spark can be ignited.  Would you like for that spark to be ignited? Yes. Yes. I've arranged to see a penguin-feeding show. Oh, awesome! Oh, thank you. I thought you would love to... That's very cool. Yeah. I do love penguins. So, you want to go and check it out? Yeah, that'd be great! Because I have cerebral palsy... Yeah. ...my favorite thing about penguins is that they walk funny. Okay. And I just love the fact that there's an animal that walks like I walk.  These are the little penguins. You have the opportunity to feed them if you want.  Absolutely! Which one of you lucky guys is gonna get the fish? Here you go. Aw, you look so cute! Waddle, waddle, waddle. They walk like me! Is it true that penguins will choose a partner and then stick with them for life?  Is that actually true? Exactly. And they sometimes will select the nest as to how well the male has actually built the nest. Oh. Oh, yes. So if you're keeping a nice house, then you'll bring the girls in. We took a ferry to Manly, once upon a time here. Oh, yeah? Nice. Yes. Yeah. It was beautiful, you know. Yeah, the Manly ferry's lovely. Oh, definitely, and... Yeah. We should do a Manly ferry trip one time. That would be great. Would be nice.  I've always wanted to go back on the ferry again.  Yeah, so we should, um... do that one time, maybe. Oh, I look forward to that. Yeah.  Sounded to me like you might have asked Mark out on a second date. Um... I... I may have, yeah.  I... I just... He was really nice, and I thought... it'd be cool to catch up again. Yeah. Well, thank you for that. No, thank you. It was wonderful. I hope we meet each other again. Yeah, definitely, we'll have to catch up. Oh, yes. Yeah. Thank you. For sure. That was great. You take care of yourself, and... Thank you. Yes. Um... Could I, um, maybe give you a hug? Is that all right? Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Oh.  I had... I like your shirt. Thank you. I had a great time with you, and... Yeah, it was great. You know, I hope we look forward to this again. Yeah, we'll definitely catch up. Bye!  Bye-bye!  It sounded like she asked you on a second date on the gondola. Yes.Absolutely. Absolutely.  That's pretty exciting. Yes. So, I look forward to that, very soon. Great. Can't wait. I'm so nervous.  Why? Because I've never done this before. Hi, my name's Olivia, uh... I'm 25, and, um... I have, uh, ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder. And I am... single.  How long have you been single for? Uh... What's today? Uh... My whole life.  What would it mean for you to find love? Amazing, I guess. I don't know. I never thought about it. 'Cause I didn't think it was ever going to happen, so...  Why don't you think it'll happen? Ninety-five percent of all people with autism don't find someone, so... probably just end up being another statistic, I guess.  Where did you get that figure from? I don't know. It could be incorrect. I found it online somewhere.  Why do you think so many people on the spectrum don't find love? I guess because of our social difficulties, I suppose. Oops.   Do you ever look at online dating? No. I've been too scared.  Why is it scary? Because on the internet, you can be anyone, and you don't know that... who they are. I'll show you. As the meme says, ""On the internet, no one knows you're a cat.""  I love cats. This is a Christmas present to myself. Her name is Duchess. I call all my cats ""Duchess."" I'm not sure why. It's supposed to walk, but this carpet's here, so it's stuck.  Is that cat's name Duchess?  It doesn't have one.  Why not? Because I hate that cat.  What's it like, being a girl on the spectrum? Extremely difficult, considering that there's no girl criteria. It's only boy. So you get... you get assessed on how male you are. This has been out all week, I should fold it. until well into adulthood.  What's important to you in life? Acting. Uh, performing. That... that is my life. That's who I am. It's my identity. I go to Options Theater Company. It's a, uh, theater company for people with disabilities. It's my home. It's my family. Without them, I don't know where... I don't know, uh, where I'd be. It... it changed my life.  Morning, Stuart. Morning, Olivia. Have you got a script? Ah, no, because I didn't realize I was gonna be doing my monologue today, on a Monday. You'll be all right. I had a hard life, growing up. So, Olivia playing Oberon.  When I came here, I felt safe for the first time in my life. I was finally with people who understood me. Where is my puck? Over the shoulder. And who get that I was different to other people, and treated me right. The trick that's coming in now is that you're setting the theme up for Midsummer Night's Dream. And that's why you're giving her the flower. The course of true love never did run smooth. Of course it doesn't.  Oh, got some feelings about that? Have you been in love before?  I have. Have you? Did it break your heart? Yes.   Yes. Yeah, but you know the feeling, right?  Yeah. And that's why... That's why Oberon is so powerful, so mischievous. He's scorned. That's why he's doing this. Hell hath no fury like a fairy king scorned. Hell hath no fury like a fairy...  Maybe that should be on the poster.  You're jumping around a bit, Olivia. Yeah, it's called disability. I jump around like a ping-pong ball when I'm happy or excited, or anxious, or nervous, or stressed. Um, those the only main triggers I know of.   At one point, we thought it was Tourette's. Another time, we thought it was chronic motor tic disorder. Many different theories, but no cigar.  And how long has that been around for? From the moment I was aware of it. I was born with it.  What does it feel like? It's a massive build-up with a pleasant release.  So, have you ever been in love? No.  Have you been in a relationship? No.  Have you been on a date? No. Yeah, so, at the moment, with my dating history, I think it's, uh, pretty poor at the moment.  So, there is no dating history. Yes. from their overseas holiday.  You like things to be clean? Oh, yes. Yeah, they'll be home soon. Just waiting for them to come down the street, actually.  Hi! -Hello, sweetheart. How are you?  Good. We missed you so much! I missed you too. Ooh, I just lost my sunglasses! That's okay. Never mind. job keeping the house nice and tidy.  Very good. And here's something that we thought you'd appreciate, Andrew, and all that. Oh, thank you. So, I'll put that with my other, um, collection of boats, and that.  So, Andrew's obviously keen to find someone special. What are your thoughts on that? Oh, we would love him to find someone, because I know how keen he is himself to get a girlfriend, and... and hopefully, one day, a wife. Because Andrew loves going out. He loves going out for dinner, and he loves going to the movies. Yep. He just doesn't want to do it with his mum and dad anymore. Oh, I still do, but because you're retired... ...you need your quiet time now. to spend your life with your mum and dad. No. We've always told Andrew, don't let anybody ever tell you that you can't do something. Andrew would always have a crack and have a go at something. Very proud of him. Very proud of him. I'd say he's a good boy, but he's no longer a boy. No, I'm a man now. That's right. A good young man. He's got the job and he's got the license. So, now he needs the girlfriend.  That's it. Andrew's ideal girl would be a girl that loves jigsaw puzzles and K'NEX. That would be... that would make it for him for the rest of his life. I just hope he finds someone that he's happy with. That's all we ever want for Andrew, is to be happy. He hasn't said it for a while, but I have heard Andrew say in the past, ""I wish I was normal.""  That must hurt a bit. Yeah, it does. How does it make you feel when you hear that?  Are you a romantic person? Yes, I'm a hopeless romantic.  Yeah?  Hmm. I love love. I love love songs, I love rom-coms. Half my songs on my iPod are roma... Are, uh, love songs and break-up songs.  Have you ever experienced unrequited love? When have I not?  I'm usually the, uh, crusher, not the crushee.  My feelings are never returned, normally.  So you've had crushes? Many.  And what... And what happens? I get very heartbroken.  Because all the guys always... Always want to hang out with me. They never want to hold my hand or date me.  How do you think it'll go today? Awful.   What are your concerns? What are you worried about? That I have a brain freeze and I don't know what to say. Or that it doesn't go well and I'm not very interesting.  It sounds like your worries are mainly about yourself... and not about whether you like the other person. Aren't they always?  Not always. Some people are very confident in themselves. I'm not confident in myself. This is a bit embarrassing. Hasn't turned up yet. I don't wanna be stood up.  There he is.  Oh, right. of slurping spaghetti...  Olivia, right? Yeah. Pleasure to meet you, I'm Christopher. You have an accent. Yeah... I know, I know. Everyone immediately thinks I'm American as soon as they meet me. Uh, do you want to get something? Yeah. Uh, hey, can I get a regular latte, if you got one? And, uh, anything you want? The easy street burger combo. Okay, uh, in that case, uh, no latte. I'll go straight for a, uh, easy street beef burger and cheese. This actually worked out better, 'cause when I first got here, it was full. Now there's no one around. I'm... Again, I'm so sorry that I waited so long. I mean, that you waited...  All right, let me start again. I know that feeling. No filter.  Ah. Ironically though, it takes me to forever to get all the thoughts out of my mouth. I mean, sometimes I immediately think that I need to, like, go on a script as soon as I meet someone. Then as soon as everything happens, I just feel like a wall just suddenly slams in there, then I can't even start to think until the whole thing's over and done with. Sorry, did I speak too fast? No, I just... I zoned out. That's all. I have this problem. Um, I know exactly the feeling. It takes me forever to try and, uh... Concentrate. Yes.  Focus. Uh-huh. Eh, trial and error. Don't you worry, I'm a bundle of nerves. Cheers to a bundle of nerves, then. And the birds.  You okay? Um... Yeah, just got a phobia of big dogs, that's all. I used to be a dog groomer. And trust me, that one's harmless. Oh, no, I'm not scared of dogs, just I'm scared of big dogs that jump. Oh.  Truth be told, I got pushed into dog grooming because of what my mother wanted me to do. I was more an actor and a writer than anything else. I'm an actor. I perform with a theater company called Options Theater Company. I would ask for, uh, contact details, but it's a bit too far for me. It's okay, you would not be allowed in anyway. It's a... It's a disability theater company. Don't know whether to take that as an insult or not. What is your disability? 'Cause I'm not seeing one. No offense. What does autism look like to you? Point taken. You should take your foot out of your mouth, sir. Thank you. I didn't know I had a foot in my mouth. Thank you very much. It is, when you say you can't see a disability, because not all disabilities are visible. And just like that, I just got proved how blind I am.  I normally don't disclose my autism straight away to people I meet. I really don't know how to properly describe myself, other than just Asperger's syndrome. That is autism. I don't know, some people say it's dyslexic, other people say autism. At this point, I just want to say, I'm a madman. Let's just go with that. My diagnosis is Asperger's. Hmm.  But because Asperger's, the term doesn't exist anymore, we're all Autism Spectrum Disorder. You okay? I choke on everything.  I'm not even sure why, I just do.  I like him. He's a really nice guy. A bit awkward, but I think we're both like that, so...  I think you just have to take... you'd have to take some time to build up the relationship.  I just like the peace and quiet around here. No, actually, that came in the right, the exact... That actually came at the right moment. You're welcome. Do you want me to start, or...? Um... Sure. I had fun. And every word that I said to you, and every word that I listened, all of it was true. You're a marvelous woman. Oh, thank you. I've never actually been told that before. I could feel that you were very genuine, yes. But I don't see this going any further.  Mmm. Not... Not really either, yeah.  Mmm. Not because of you or your faults. No, seriously, look at me. I can't, the sun's in my eyes. Hang on. How-how's that? How's... How's that? Yeah.  Okay, there we go. Nothing that you did has put me off. It's just that whenever I try and look for someone, I need to find a... spark. Okay. Anything...  Ah. Sorry... My jaw just clicked. Ah. Oh. I actually thought you were about to cry. No! My jaw clicked. It's all right. Ah. Well, I definitely want us to meet again. So, uh... Do you want me to, or...? Uh... Whatever you're comfortable with. Handshake, or...? Uh... Yeah, handshake. Okay. I'm a huggy person, but I don't know you that well, so... Fair enough, fair enough. Ah. All right. Well, thank you very much. You too. Look after yourself. I will. by a local disability organization. Good luck, darling.  See ya. See you later.  Bye. Hey, how you doing? Hi. Milly. Milly, Andrew. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Andrew. I'm just gonna get you to sign in real quick. Yes, excellent. I have had quite a lot of people ask me for this event, because people with these kinds of differences or disabilities find it really hard finding other people. And so, we want everybody to have the opportunity to fit in. Thank you all so much for coming this evening. I know it's terrifying and you're probably a bit nervous. So, if you need any help, feel free to just stick your hand up or start screaming. Whatever you want to do, that's fine. There are a couple of things on the table to help out. So these are questions if you're having trouble and want something to prompt. The other thing there is there are different questions on each of the numbers. So you can use the number cards, or you can use these if you want. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. We're not here to judge, we're just here to make friends.  Feeling a bit nervous, actually. Yeah, just I don't want to make a fool of myself, don't want to embarrass myself. Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm Casey. Casey? Nice to meet you. Hi, yeah. Nice to meet you. Yep. So, um, have you got a job at the moment, Casey? Yes, I work at a... like, the canteen café at the Newcastle University. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Are you still, um, living with your parents or are you by yourself? Yeah. I am. Yeah. I still live with my parents... Okay. ...but I will be moving out with my friend soon. Oh, okay, yeah. I'm still living with my parents at the moment, but... Yeah.  Hmm. Ah, pretty good. Um... Any good questions?  No... I'm trying to, yeah, find some good questions. Um...  Have you got a favorite movie? Favorite movie. Um... Movies done by M. Night Shyamalan. Oh, yes. Um... Yeah, I'm not really, uh, fussed on those, actually. No? No. What movies do you like? Probably, um, James Bond, um, maybe some of the old, children's, um, movies, like Toy Story, Oh, yeah. Gosh. Those ones obviously everyone would like, wouldn't they? Ah, very good. Well, it's, um, nice meeting you. Yeah, it was nice meeting you, too. Yep. Hi. Hi. I'm Andrew. I'm Evie. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice... Yeah. Uh... So, tell me about yourself. I like to bake cakes, Yep. I like watching anime... Yep. ...and I just am obsessed with animals. Okay. Have you got a favorite animal? Uh, wolves. I wanted to work with wolves in Canada. Okay. What about you? What do you do? Um, family, I work actually. I work for, uh, Family and Community Services. Oh. So, it's a, um... Yeah, a bit of data entry, uh, stock control, like, the stationery ordering and that, yeah. Um, I need those cards, actually. Sorry, I'm not really good at talking. No, no, no, it's okay. I figure we've done all the good ones, so, um... Yep. Uh, let's see. Um... Ah, no... If your life was a movie, which celebrity would you play? Ah, Kate Hutchins. I love her. Okay... Oh, yes, now I know who she is. That... Yes. Yeah, um, I don't mind. Um... Have you heard of, uh, Pierce Brosnan? Um, James Bond? Yeah. Yes, he's my favorite, um, actor, actually. Um, yeah. Yeah, do you have a favorite movie? I know it's childish. No, no, no, that's okay. I don't mind Toy Story as well. Like, all the children's, um, shows, like The Lion King, Toy Story... Yeah. Like the old versions, not the new ones. No, no. 'Cause the new ones are kind of stuffed up. Yeah. I think probably Toy Story and Toy Story 2 would probably be my best, yeah. Well, it's nice meeting you. Yeah. See you again. See ya! who he would like to see again. if the other person also chooses him. I'm actually leaning towards, uh, Evie, because I could see she was a nice girl, um, beautiful, um, her hair was good...  You've just gotta hope she chooses you too, hey? Yes. So, fingers crossed. Yep. Hey... Oh, are you heading off? Yeah, I'm heading off. So, it was very nice to meet you. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I'm really awkward with people. No, that's all right. It's your first time with me, you're a bit nervous and that, yeah. But nice meeting you. See ya Jared! See ya!  Yep. Hello.  How you doing? Good. I'm excited. Nervous, excited.  Oh, yeah? Yes.  In a good way? Yeah. It's different than last time. I feel more prepared than last time. I am going to wear... this, and this... and those shoes. to meet someone new. being eaten.  Hi. Hi. I'm Thomas.  I'm Olivia. Are you a hugger or a shaker? Both. Oh, well, bring it in. I'm very affectionate.  Me too.  Oh, I'm Thomas. Sorry. Do you have an accent? I like to think I've got the autism accent.  Oh. From all the, uh, video games and movies I watch. I've got a bit of Polish blood in me. Oh, nice. What do you like to do for fun? Play video games. Likewise.  Yes. I don't know about you, but I'm sensitive to sounds and smells... Not smells, but sounds. Sounds? Oh, yeah. And so, sometimes, when it comes to certain... abrupt sounds  or... Yes. ...odors, if you will... I just, like... I'm like, ""Okay, I'm out. Nope, I'm gone.""  Oh, hey.  Oh! I thought it'd better to go the soft-drink route rather than the alcohol route. I don't drink, so that's all right. That's all right, we'll... We shall enjoy our fine beverages. It's orange, like my hair. How long do you have to spend with your hair? Because it looks quite lovely. I didn't do anything today, I just brushed it. Really? Ah.  Yes. See, for me, I... I go through a vigorous schedule. I get mousse, I stylize it, and then I get, uh, my comb and I roll it through, and then I get some hair fiber and put it through. Huh? Sorry, I zoned out. Sorry, my bad. Oh, that's okay, I zone out too. So, you said you had a movement disorder? I think one of my, um, students on the spectrum has that as well. No, they don't. I guarantee they don't. Because no one in this world knows what it is. Really? Happens to the best of us.  Oh! It's all good. It was going so well. That's okay. I... I've already... I've forgotten it already. I'm a big fan of voluminous hair, and she had volume. And I was like, wow, that's great to see. Uh, then when we started talking, and I noticed that she was as lively as I was, it's always great to meet someone who shares your... types of, you know, engagement. It's always hard to speak with someone who is, you know, very shut off. Shall we get out of here?  Yes. Awesome. I know just a... A nice little walk along the weir. And I've got a little surprise for you, too, okay? Oh, I'm scared now! Oh, no, don't worry. Nothing's gonna come out of the bushes or whatever.  Did you want me to put the jumper on for you?  Yes.  Awesome. There you go. Yeah, just a generally nice person to be around and... quite... quite chatty. I think I've just discovered what it's like to hear myself for an hour. Oh, this is nice. Yeah. Uh, do you go for many walks along the water? No, but I always say I'm gonna do it, but I never do. I need to do it more. Yeah. So, I thought a little bit of a moonlight dance would be nice.  Oh, I can't remember what this dance was... I'm not quite sure either.  Something wrong? Please don't do that. You're making fun of my disability. No, I wasn't doing that. Sorry. I was actually dancing to the, uh... the beat. That's all. I... I... I'm sorry it came off like that. I didn't mean to do it. That's all right. I got to ask, how did you feel tonight went? Um... You can give me your honest opinion. It's not that... You know, I... I can take it. Ah... I think we got along pretty well. We did, yeah. If you want, um, we could catch up, maybe in the city? Uh... I'd like to talk online first for a while. That sounds like a good idea. Very amicable suggestion, indeed. Well, it was a pleasure to, uh, meet you. I'll see you around. Yep. Bye. Bye.  In your family, you feel like you're the only one who's still struggling to find someone. That's it. It feels, uh, sad, uh, a bit upset... Because I want to actually start my own family, um, um, as soon as possible, and that.  So you feel you're running out of time? Yes. Still nothing. if he has a match. ""Hi, Andrew. Thank you for attending our Sen speed dating. Your matches for the evening are as follows: Evie. The next step is up to you.""  So that's good news. Yes, excellent.  How do you feel about that? Very excited. Actually, very pleased with myself.  Well done. Thank you. High five!"
Love On The Spectrum,01,05,"""Hi. I'm really sorry, but I can't go out with you today, or for a while. I'm going through some very personal stuff. Sorry for wasting your time. Evie."" Um, I... And then I replied back, saying, um, ""Hi, Evie. Not a problem. I totally understand. Let me know when you are feeling much better, if you want to catch up for a coffee."" And then, that's it.  It sounded like things were looking good, and then... she changed her mind? Yes.  Hi. Hi, I'm Sharnae, and I'm 21 years old, and I'm on the spectrum.  Describe for me what your ideal partner would be like. Caring, amazing, good-looking. Jimmy? Come here. Hello. James. Yeah. You have to look at him. Hey.  You feeling a bit stressed? I'm here. Look at me. Hello. We'll do it together.  How long have you known each other? Two years. Yeah, two. A-Almost three. Almost three years. Yeah.  What did you think when you first met, Jimmy? just thought I was attractive. He's sexy. I was just, like, ""Mum, there's this hot guy at Job Centre. I... I'm gonna ask him out."" At that point, I didn't even know I was on the spectrum. I just knew I was different. And Sharnae just... She just felt similar to me, but... more like she just knew what I was... what I was thinking. Even before I was diagnosed, she just called me autistic, or told everyone I was autistic... Yeah. Pretty much. ...'cause she believed it so much. I did.  How old were you when diagnosed, Jimmy? Well, I was 20. I'm 21 now.  Wow. I don't know how they missed it.  What did you think when you were diagnosed? I didn't change.  Why do you think you guys are compatible?  Are you compatible? I hope so.  What does ""compatible"" mean? Compatible means, uh, do we have... Do we... Do we go well together? Oh, yeah. Sorry, I didn't know what that word meant. Yes, we do. We were made for each other. I love Sharnae. I love Jimmy.  Ooh.   I've got you.  Ooh, thank you. That's okay. Yep, and put that in the cupboard.  So, there's two knives and two forks?  Yeah, and two plates.  Yes.  What if you have guests? They can bring their own. Paper plates.  Or bring their own. Or bring their own plates and cutlery. It makes sense. It does. Yeah.  Yeah.  Did Sharnae make that?  Yeah.    Oh, goodness, what's this?  Oh, wanna see it?    Me and her, printed on a blanket. Yeah. It's really soft, too. So it's sensory. We like that kinda stuff, 'cause, yes, we're autistic, so we like sensory stuff.  Why do you put the eye masks on them? I don't know. It's just happy there. Yeah. It feels right.  Yeah.  Would you say this is a big step in your relationship? Oh, yes. Yeah, very big. Yeah. Yeah, the biggest so far. We've been wanting to do it for ages now, so... about time we move in together. Yeah. Yeah. Found a house, perfect. Yeah.  What's all this, Jimmy?  They're all my puzzles.  He lines it all up.  I was making sure it was nice.  It looks good.  How long does it take to solve a Rubik's Cube? I like to get sub-one-minute, but... mostly around the one-minute mark.  What is it you love about doing these puzzles?  I don't know, they're kind of just cool. I originally got the Rubik's Cube to keep my fingers and hands busy when I'm anxious, and I still like them.  Did you just finish it?  Yeah.  So you like solving things in your brain. I like to solve things in my brain, yeah. I see pool like that, as well. Every rack is a different puzzle. I c... I see it all before it all goes down. They're small, easy puzzles, but they're still puzzles. That must be my pool table.  Yeah, let's go see it! Dun-da-da! Okay. Come on, hold my hand. Okay. Come on.  Okay.  Hello. Out the back? That way. Yeah? Yep. in his backyard.  Wow, there we go.  It definitely fits, then.  Are you a pro player, Jimmy?  Nope. Yes.  You've only been playing pool for like... Two years. Yeah.  Only two years? That's not long. No, it's not. He's already off the rails. Like, really, really good. It's possible that it's an obsession. It's all I can think about, so...  Just Sharnae and pool. Yeah.  Yeah. Yep. Indeed.  Do you guys remember your first date? Yes. The movies.  Did you watch the movie? Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, it's a cinema. Why else would you go to the movies? Some do it to make out, that's what he meant. Oh, did he? Yeah. That's what he meant, isn't it? No. The movies are too good. Yeah, it was a good movie. We holded hands the whole time... Held. We hold han... held hands the whole time, and our arms were getting dead. And pins and needles, really hurting. That's what we thought that you do on first dates. I wasn't... I wasn't sure of the protocol. Yeah. I didn't know, because I'd never been on a date before, so I thought it was normal too. So... And then we kissed on the first date, too, so...  Ooh. Yeah. And then pretty much after that, he asked me out. Straight after. And then we were official. Isn't that right? And then Facebook official. I don't like kissing. Kissing's scary.  Don't do tongue. No, I just don't like it. It just feels weird. It's like a lizard. Stop that.  We do kiss.  Oh, nah...  Yeah, we do.  We do.  Yeah, of course. And we hold hands for, like, ten seconds.  About. About ten. Five to ten seconds, never above ten, but never below five.  Yeah. True that, yeah. And I'm fine with that. I don't... I don't really mind.  Is intimacy important in a relationship? Intimacy... Intimacy's easy. Yeah. Yeah, it's easy.  You don't have to answer. Have you guys consummated your relationship? No, I actually do know what it means. Yes. Obviously. As I said, it's easy. That stuff's easy. Yeah.   What do you think would be the biggest challenge for you in dating, or in a relationship? Probably, um, that, um...  uh, good conversation, and especially eye contact as well.  So, communication? Uh, yes. has come to work with him  Hi, I'm Andrew. Come in. Nice to meet you. I'm Jodi.  Jodi, nice to meet you. Come... Come on in.  I absolutely love working with people on the autism spectrum, because every single person is really different, and the things that they're skilled at, or their special interests are really amazing. I learn something different about being on the spectrum from every single person that I meet. All right, so... what do you want a girlfriend for? Just, um, like, um, start my own family and that. To be a good father, and also to keep the family name going and that... That's a very traditional way of thinking, isn't it? Yes. So, what's the very first step for this plan? It's get a girlfriend. Exactly. Yeah. So, when you went on the speed dating, did you meet anyone? Um, there... there was this, um, young, um, lady by the name of Evie. But then she came down with some, um, like, personal issues and that. So, I... I do have the, um, text here. So... So, just, um, from that there. ""Hi, I'm really sorry, but I can't go out with you today, or for a while."" Oh. How did... When you get a message like that... Yep. ...what did you think? Um, I felt a... a bit down, and a bit, um, upset and that. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that that means there is a future possibility of going out, or do you think that means that's the end of this? I think maybe there'll be a possibility in the... the future and that. But sometimes the words that come out of our mouth... Yeah. ...are not really what we're thinking. When somebody actually says, ""I'm so sorry, I can't get together... dot, dot, dot, dot, dot... for a while,"" what do you think she's thinking? Mmm.  Yeah, that's a really hard question. This is the... one of the hardest parts about relationships. Because... in her mind, she was probably thinking to herself, ""I like the look of that Andrew fella."" And then she's thinking, he's not boyfriend material."" Okay. We're strange, humans. Because rather than just sending a text saying, ""Great to get to know you... Yeah. ...but you are not boyfriend material.""  Hmm. Instead of saying things how they really are, what we do is we try and make another person feel okay.  Okay. Yep. And do you think Evie wanted to hurt your feelings? No, she... No way! No. How many dates had you been on before meeting Evie at speed dating? None. None?! No. It takes a lot of dates before you find the right person for you. Yes. Doesn't it? Mmm. So, that's good practice for the next date that's gonna happen. Okay. Do you find body language difficult? I think, um, when I was in school, um, yes. I don't know if I still do, actually. Okay, so if you wanted to show a girl that you're really into what she's saying, what would you do with your face? That's quite good. I like the... the eyes opening up like this. Mmm. If you're going to meet someone, do you practice? I think, like, I normally have like a script in my head, like what questions I'm going to ask her and that. All right, so tell me the questions when you would go on a... a date with somebody.  How old are they. Um, do you work? Um, do you have any hobbies that you like? Do you live with your, um, parents?  All right, so here's your list of questions. You take hold of that one. Yep. I'm meeting you for the first time, so I'm gonna have a list of questions, too, in my head, that are important. All right, you start the conversation, and we'll see if you can actually keep it going. Yep. Okay, how old are you? Twenty-one. Um, what do you do for work? I work with plants. Um, do you have any hobbies or interests? I like going to the gym... and I like doing jigsaw puzzles. Oh, very good. I like doing jigsaw puzzles as well. Um... Do you live with your parents or do you live by yourself? I live by myself.  Okay. Hmm. That's about it.  Yeah, I know. It's hard, isn't it? I know, very hard and that. Every time... there's a question...  Yep.  ...and we have an answer, we think to ourselves, ""How could I keep them talking about that?"" Hmm. Because otherwise, we go on a date, we have four questions... Yeah. ...the date could be finished in three minutes. So let's practice again. H-How old are you? I am 21.  Hmm. Have you had your 21st birthday yet? Excellent! There you go. Oh, yes, I had a great 21st birthday party.  Hmm. Three of my friends went to the movies. Okay. When you did go to the movies with your friends, what movie did you go and see? You're good. That's excellent. I went and saw Fast and the Furious 3. Oh! Well, that... I like the Fast and the Furious, um, movies. I prefer, uh, number six, actually. Look at us. What have we just found out together? Very interested in movies. How did you show me with your face? Ah, well done! Up with your eyebrows. You... I saw it. So you need to know, you can do this. Autism isn't stagnant. People develop, and they change, and you can see with Andrew that he's learnt a lot of skill about social connection with other people. But it's quite rigid. Thank you for coming and, um, teaching me some things. Andrew needs support to understand how do we follow and continue and keep a conversation going with another person, so a date doesn't finish in three and a half seconds and feel like an interrogation. And, um, have a good day.  Thank you. See you later. See you, Jodi.  What's the hardest thing about being on the spectrum? We do get major anxiety. We get busy heads. So sometimes, you know, like a roller coaster. Well, it's just... I think it's just annoying when other people just don't see what I see.  Hmm.  Is change hard to deal with? Change is like a bad holiday.  Yeah. I like holidays, but I don't like changes much. Change. I like planned change.  Yeah. So if you can plan change, it's very, very good. Easier. And if we... Yeah, if we get it on the spot, we're like, ""Oh,"" you know? Yeah, it freaks me out. Yeah, it freaks us out. Sometimes it will...  Yeah. ...ruin my whole night, even for pool. Yeah. I'll turn up expecting one thing, and then something might go wrong, and it will make the whole night a lot harder.  See ya later.  I don't think I can do it.  You don't have to, Jimmy. I just can't. Maybe in different circumstances. I just don't... think so.  You don't think so? Wanna have a drink, see how you feel? I want lemon, lime, and bitters. Lemon, lime, and bitters now? Yes. Yes, okay.  Is it that you don't want to play pool, or...? I want to play pool, I just don't... think so.  Is it 'cause we're here? Or is it 'cause there's... People.  People you don't know? I don't know these guys. If it was like a normal night, everyone in this... this whole room, I would know. But it's not like that at all. I don't know if I can do this. I don't know... Here, have a drink. Thanks. A little bit of freak-out, yeah? No, I'm having a lot of bit of freak-out. I know. Righty-o. Best of three, gentlemen. So, that's the game. Thanks. Yeah.  No need to be nervous.  All good. Righty-o, gentlemen. Best of luck. Round two. You good? Yeah.  Whoa, that was good, wasn't it? I like it. Thanks. Well done! Jimmy, well done. Yeah, thanks. That money's yours. Milady...  Thank you, sir.  How are you feeling about the dates you went on? There were a couple of things where my filter got in the way. A couple of things where I was wishing... Internally wishing I hadn't said it, and stuff like that. First dates never really go... never... never really are good, are they?  What's autism feel like for you? It's like being in a transparent box. No one can hear you, no one can... They can see you, but they can't interact with you. You can bang on the wall, but you can't get out of it, so it's very lonely being in the box your entire life. 'Cause no one can get in, and you can't get out. And no one can understand you. to meet someone new. Hi, I'm Jackson. I'm Olivia. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. You look lovely. Thank you. Well, yes. Yeah. Bit hard to sit down on these chairs. Whereabouts in Central Coast are you from? Gosford. So am I! I live in North Gosford. Oh, really? No way! Yes. So close to each other. That's so weird.  Yeah, it is weird, isn't it? What do you like to do? I'm a gamer. What sort of games? Planning to get the new Mortal Kombat game. Oh, that's a good game, yeah. So, like, anything else you do, like your hobbies, or...? Um, well, I'm an actor. Oh, are you? Wow. Yes, with a theater company for disabled people. Really? Yeah. Oh, cool. My autism helps me with that a lot. Also, being very emotional, which comes from my autism, so... My, uh, autism gives me a very creative side. Yeah. Uh, but I also have very high thinking, but I'm, like, slow, uh, motor speeds. When I was really little, I used to just go round banging my head on shit, just for the fun of it. Would you like to get a drink or coffee? I don't drink coffee, I'd like a drink. Yeah. I'll go get you one. Yeah.  I'll be back in just a sec. Yep.  So, what do you think? I'm liking. I know you've been wanting to hear that for about three dates now.  Here you are. I wasn't diagnosed till I was 18. Yeah, about the same for me. I think 19, maybe.  It's the anniversary next week, actually, because I was diagnosed two days before my 18th birthday. Oh, were you? Yes. Oh, okay. Up until then, I didn't have any disability help whatsoever. You never got any help whatsoever? No. I almost had to repeat, even with support, so that's amazing. I do have social difficulties. Problem is... they overlooked my symptoms, because, as a child, none of my symptoms were out of place for a child that age. Oh, really? Because it presents differently in girls, and there's no criteria for girls. Oh, that's a bit silly.  Yeah, I know. Which is why I got...  Whoa, sorry.  Overlooked. It is.   But you're right, now. You're having some trouble here and there, and I have some trouble time to time, too, but, you know, uh, I think you're very lovely, and, uh, I don't think there's anything really that wrong with you.  Aww.  Uh, I've organized a pottery class. Would you like to go do that with me? Yeah, sure. Really? Yeah. All right. Well, good. Let's go!  I think she's very sweet and she's very cute too. I like that she can laugh at anything. That's very nice. You still a bit cold? Yeah, but nothing you can do about it. Would you like my jacket? You sure? Yeah, have my jacket.  Thank you. She's also got pretty red hair. I can be a bit of a sucker for redheads.  Do you want me to make something for you or something? Maybe I can make a controller for you, since you're so into games. All right. We're going all Ghost on this date, with pottery. I can't imagine how they would've done that scene. Uh, well, probably would have to do a lot of retakes.  It's a bit creepy, because he's a ghost. Yeah. A bit touchy-feely. Maybe I would do something like that, but not on camera, I think. That's something couples do in private, I think. Yeah.  There you go. PlayStation controller. Yay!   Thank you. I really enjoyed the day, and I enjoyed your company. I just really want to get to know you more. You know? Same. Would you like to do this again? Yeah, sure! Can I get your number? Sure, um... Um... Here. Put the game on pause. Uh...   Okay. Save... Olivia. Mine can take a picture, so I'll take a picture of you. All right. So, um, maybe we'll do this again some other time, yeah? Yeah, I'd love to. All right. Yeah. Let's go.  Let's go.  What do you guys dream about for your future together? Well, we wanna get married one day, but first, we're gonna travel. I wanna just do all of the things that Sharnae never thought she would be able to do. Breathe in the Gold Coast air. for tomorrow.  Hey, you! Hello. What are you doing?  What have you got planned for your holiday?  We're going to theme parks. We're also going to a romantic dinner together.  Ooh! Ooh!  Yeah, we don't usually go on romantic dates, because that means you have to go to restaurants, and that means you have to go to places where people are. We have dinner at our house, that's romantic. Ooh.  Ooh.  Here to check in. Lovely. Yes. Just a photo ID for check-in. There you go. So just reconfirming, you've booked a one-bedroom ocean spa apartment for three nights. Yeah! Fancy. This is the rules. It just says don't lose the keys... Yeah, we don't do that. We follow rules. Perfect. So, just both names and signatures. We love rules.   Right there. Ooh.  Oh, my God. Whoa, this is pretty cool!  There's flowers. Oh, chocolates! Ooh, fancy. Are they chocolates or soap? No, chocolate.  Oh, cool. These spoons are the wrong way around, though.  Holy shit! We got a bath!  Oh, look at the bath! Look at that! Look at that!  Oh, my...  God!  ...God! That's so cool. Holy shit!  Whoo! Wanna go out on the veranda? It's raining. Here we go. It's gonna be scary. I can't open it.  I'm so weak. That way. Together. Go.  We're gonna break it.  There's a technique. What do you do?  I don't know! No... You would think, with our beautiful minds, we'd be able to open a freaking door. Wait, this one might open. Nah, key.  We don't have a key, but we can go out here. Oh, my Lord!  Aah! Oh, my God! We could die. Shh! Don't touch it! Oh, look at the ocean view! Isn't it beautiful at nighttime?  Isn't it just?  Wee! It's nice and comfy. Yeah.  Aah! Aah.  Mmm.  Aah!    Yeah. Uh-oh! They could've died. Yeah, man. Gotta wait for the green light. Rules are rules. I'm gonna go on this. Wee! Go this way. Nae!  That was fun.  You're crazy.  By the way, have you noticed we actually hold hands for longer than five seconds of duration?  True!  When did that change? Um... I don't know. Jimmy's getting used to it more.  Is that a holiday rule? Yeah, no. No, I think I just wanna be... as close to Sharnae at all times... Yeah. 'cause she is my friend. I love it. I love you. Yuck! Can I kiss you? No! Why? We're still on camera.  I don't care about the cameras. It's just me and you.    What's happening tonight? Tonight me and Jimmy are going on a romantic dinner.  So exciting. I'm getting all ready for it. This outfit I got from the shops. It looks like a dress, but it's pants.  Very cute. Dress... pants. Dress... pants. Dress... pants. Hello. You're looking good! Gonna put your jacket on?  He's looking very handsome. Yes, very handsome. Very nice, sexy boy.  Hmm. I need navy socks. You should get some navy socks. Should've got navy socks. Idiot. Pants are a bit longer.  Navy socks. When you get a navy suit, get navy socks.  Yeah. Brown shoes go with navy suits, not black shoes. But black socks definitely don't go with navy suits. No.  I need navy socks.  Yes.  Is there a store around here... Maybe tomorrow. It's too late. Get my bag. Look, 'cause if I go like this...  Yep, we know.  Like that... Black socks don't go with...  Yep. We'll get navy socks.  Idiot.  Got your cube? Can you get them ones, please? Ready to go now? You gonna do that first?  You're a bit... You're upset, aren't you? Yes.  Navy socks.  What do we do now? Get navy socks. Yeah, we'll go get navy socks now. Come on.  All right, bye. I'm going to buy navy socks. I need navy socks.  Have any rules for dating?

Very nice, actually.  Hmm.  Got close to the ball. So do you, uh, live with your, uh, parents, Carly? I live at home with my parents. Yep. Sorta thing. So what about you... I'm still... ...Andrew?  Yes, I'm still living with my parents at the moment. Okay. Do you drive a car, have your license? Um, it's more like, I've got epilepsy.  Oh, I understand. That one was a bit too fast, actually. Yeah, I think it was. Yep. So, have you been on any, um, dating, um, history, gone on a date night or something?  Um... I was with someone before I met you, so... Yeah? It's kind of been a bit of a... Like, couple months out of it, just me trying to... Oh, yes. Get, like... get back to my usual self. That's it. I... I understand that. I was, um...  I had someone, uh, before, and, yeah, went on a date night... Uh, it was a bit like one of those speed dating nights. Oh, yeah. There was... someone matches you, um, which they did, but then, after that, um, that didn't go down too well, actually. Oh, okay.  Yes. That's not good. No, it's a bit disappointing, but these things happen. Yeah.  Yep. Ooh, so close. Just take my jacket off. It's starting to warm up, actually. Um, do you want to go... have a drink of water, actually... Yeah. ...before we continue? Yeah. If that's all right.  Yep. Mmm. Very nice. Yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah.  I... Have I... Um, okay... Like, am I not making you feel a bit uncomfortable and that? It's real... It's good. Yeah. It's good. Yeah? Okay. I'm just, you know... trying to be a bit careful. Yep. So, do you s... see yourself one day starting your own family and that? Oh. Eventually, when I hit those... hit the right timing, yes. Oh, okay. Because I'm just trying to get used to the adult... life. Yeah. Same thing with me as well. Like, sometimes I tend to, um, step ahead or rush things, but I've gotta step back and think, ""Okay, this takes time"" and that. Yeah.  Yep. So, you ready to get back into another game? Yep. Okay.  So, where I stand here... Yeah? The ball needs to come through... my legs, actually. Uh, not bad. Bit of practice. Am I making you feel a bit uncomfortable with all these, um, tips and rules about lawn bowls? Yeah, it's good, it's good. It's just, I'm trying my hardest. That's okay. It's practice. Is that right?  Uh... No, other side. That's it.  Oh.  Now, if I had my hat on, I would take it off. Because that would be a great shot. It was, wasn't it? Yep.  Oh, here we go, a nice spot out here.  Yeah, it is, yeah.  There we go. There we go.  Well, very good. Uh... So, what would be your ideal dream partner? Um... Mine would be, like, for someone to... you know, sort of care about me. Yes. Not just, you know... use me for other stuff.  Yep. It's more like, trying to be polite to me. Yeah. Polite to you, um, like, um... Understand. Yeah. Especially with your medical condition, epilepsy. Yeah.  So when the time does happen, when you do, um, g-get really sick, or, um, not stable, you've got someone there to care for you and that? Yeah. What about with you, like...? I think my dr... Um, dream partner would be, yeah, someone nice, um, someone who has an understanding with, uh, disability and that, um, especially with my, um, intellectual disability and that, um... Yeah, that's pretty much about it. Yeah.  Hmm. Well, thank you, Carly. Thank you, Andrew. Yep. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, and have a safe trip back home. Yep. Same to you. Okay. Bye, Carly. See ya. He seems really polite to me, which is a good way to have it.  Hmm. But would you like to see him again? Yeah, possibly. But I'll just have to check with my parents.  Hmm.  It was a really good date. I probably will see her again, but, um, probably not at the moment. Yeah, I might have to give her a bit of space.  You had some fun, anyway. Yes, I did.  So, what now? What's next? Continue, um, going on those, um, dating, um, sites. Um, yeah, and just keep trying. That's the main thing.  Keep going. Yes. Never give up. Stop walking so fast, man. I'm on high heels.  for their special night.  Sharnae thinks we're going to dinner... but I got a surprise for her instead.  How big is the surprise? Um, life-changing.  ♪ Singing a song I'm walking up the steps 'cause... Because you don't want to fall over? I'm in high heels. What the hell?   What the...  Than you ever wrapped your head around ♪ Sharnae... will you marry me? Yes! Yes!    Are you okay? I love you. Me too. I know. You did good. That's pretty. I love it. You like it? Yeah.   You cheeky bugger. Now you definitely get to spend the rest of your life with me.  Yes, forever. I can't wait to tell the whole world. Whoo!"
Love Is Blind,01,01,"When I heard about this experiment, I knew it was for me. It was the opposite of what modern dating has become. There's so many dating apps, and most of them are based off of your physical appearance. It's not all about physical attraction, in the long run. It's who's holding your hand on your deathbed. The reason I came here is there's men who actually want to get married, they want commitment. They're looking for wives. I'm like, ""What? Where?"" Go get what you want ♪ - Wow. - Hi! I'm Briana! I really want a man who is going to love me for me. Not what I look like, but for who I am on the inside. When we're 95 years old, my boobs might be, like, dragging on the floor, but I need you to love my saggy boobs. That was real extra, but that's really how I feel. Oh, shit. This is dope. Oh, man! I'm short, and there are women out there that won't date guys that are shorter. Westley. It's a bummer, but being in this facility, we're really getting down to what matters most. Growing up, I wanted to be like Hugh Hefner, a stylish guy who can have his pick of the litter. But there comes a time in every man's life where he has to settle down. I'm so ready to find a wife. Oh, my gosh, you guys! - Hi! - Hey, hey! Oh, my God! - Hi! - Hi! How you guys doing? - Freaking out a little bit! - Yeah? Welcome. I'm Vanessa Lachey. I'm obviously Nick Lachey, her husband. Ladies, welcome to the blind love experiment. Here, you will choose someone to marry... without ever seeing them. We live in such a disconnected and distracted world. Your value is often judged solely by the photo on your dating app. - Mm-hmm. - True. That's true. But everyone wants to be loved for who they are. Not for their looks, their race, their background or their income. - Right. - So true. Psychologists believe that emotional connection is the key to long-term marital success... So here, your relationships will begin by forging an intimate bond, with nothing to distract you. Here's how it's going to work. Over the next ten days, ladies, you're going to live on this side, and the men will live on the other side. You're going to speak to a stream of potential love interests. But here's the catch. Looks won't play a factor. We've taken away your devices. The only time you're going to interact is in one of the private pods. You're going to be separated by one thin wall. You won't ever get to see each other. Ultimately, all decisions are yours. You can choose who you want to spend time with. Once you choose the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, - you'll propose. - Just like that? If they accept, you will finally get to see your fiancée for the very first time. You're going to leave here together as an engaged couple with a wedding date. - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my God. You'll move in together, see your family and friends, and in just four weeks, you'll be at your wedding. I just got goosebumps. Is this registering for other people? This is arguably the biggest decision you'll ever make in life. Will you say ""I do"" to the person that you've chosen right here, sight unseen? Or will physical realities in the real world sabotage you, and will you walk away from them forever? This literally is the first time an experiment like this has ever been done. We all have to remember the central question: Is love truly blind? We hope so. If you're ready to find the love of your life, then walk through those doors, because the pods are now open. I'm going first! If I fall in love and get engaged, it will be with someone I've never seen. It's crazy. - It's go time. - Whoo! I'm gonna go on a series of speed dates, and find my king, because I'm the queen, and he might be on the other side of the wall, if I'm lucky. The only weird part is that some of these women might be trying to get my husband. Basically I'm going to be blind dating all these women. - It's game time. - Game time. Get that wife, get that wife. They can't see how fly I am, they can't say, ""Oh, he's handsome."" They can't say, ""Oh, I like chocolate skin and beards."" They have to rely on my personality. It's literally blind love. Good luck. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, hello! Oh, wow! These rooms are nice! Hello? Noiseproof. Welcome to my pod. Yeah! Nice to hear from you. - Right? - I can't say ""see you."" What are you looking at? It looks like a scene from Frozen. I'm going straight for the candy over here right now. Uh, I might go for the vodka, to be honest. - Can you see anything? - No. There's nothing happening? Nothing. My name is Jessica Baton, I'm from Rock Falls, Illinois. I've had a rigid set of standards. I would only date a guy between one to five years older. I would only date athletes, because I'm really athletic. But I'm 34 years old, and I may not find someone based on the criteria that I've put in place for myself. I'm ready to start a family, and I want to have the most perfect marriage. - What's your name? - I'm Jessica. Nice to meet you, Jessica. I'm Mark. Nice to meet you, Mark. Well, let's just get right down to it! Tell me about your family. Both my parents are immigrants. They both came from Mexico. And I'm a mama's boy. Okay! I'll make a note of that! My grandma had 15 kids. - You're kidding me? - Swear. - You know what I'm saying? - That's crazy. I'm Mark Cuevas, I'm 24 years old, and I'm from Chicago, Illinois. Both my parents are from Mexico. I'll never forget my first date with one of my girlfriends in high school. She had told her dad that I was Mexican, and he opened the door and he goes, ""Oh, you're not what I expected."" And that's why I love this experiment, because it lets you really dig deep on who someone really is, and not worry about what they look like. So, I'm 24. - I'm 34. - Okay. I never dated anyone younger than me. - Really? - I think every relationship is different and you have to take things as they come. I feel that. Where you from? I'm from Illinois. - Me, too. What part? - You're kidding? I'm from two hours west of Chicago. - Go Cubbies! - I was about to say, ""Oh, my God, she's a Cubs fan!"" Huge Cubs fan, huge Bears fan. I'm a Bears fan till I die. Every Sunday, I dress up my dog. Her name is Payton Hester. No freaking way! I dress her in her Payton jersey... ...and we watch the Bears. You know what? I make the best Italian beef. - Seriously? - Oh! It's like... I'm starring your name with ""Italian..."" No, literally, my Italian beef is the best. I'm smiling. I don't know if you can tell. Oh, my gosh. I'm so happy you're here. This is awesome. I came in here open to doing this experiment, but I really didn't think that I would connect with someone off the bat like that, and with Mark it was just instant. We're different race, we're different age, but we're definitely cut from the same cloth. Bro, that was awesome! It's fun meeting so many different men who are ready to get married. The quality of men is excellent. My name is Lauren Speed, and I'm 32. I am originally from Detroit. My mom calls me at least once a week and reminds me that my eggs are shriveling up. Like, no lie. I'm just really ready for my husband, and I know that he's out there looking for me, and it's time for us to find each other and quit playing these games, okay? It's time. - Hello? - Hello. - I'm Lauren. - I'm Cameron. Where are you from, Cameron? I'm from the state of Maine. I don't think I've met anyone from Maine before. I'm the only one you'll ever need to meet. I like that. I like that. What kind of work do you do? I work in artificial intelligence. When you say ""artificial intelligence,"" I think about building robots and... Yeah, I'm basically taking over the world. That's awesome. My name is Cameron Hamilton. I'm 28, and I'm from Lee, Maine. I always hear, ""You don't look like a scientist,"" which is kind of a funny thing because, like, what does a scientist really look like? But, as a scientist, I'm a believer in this experiment that's removing the confounding variables of ethnicity, race, background, and the big one being physical appearance. None of that matters. Would you say that you're an introvert or an extrovert? I think I'm more naturally introverted, but I can be extroverted when I need to be. - Okay. - How about yourself? I think I'm a combination of the two. When I am around other people, I'm totally on, but there are times when I'm like, I just want to sit at home watch movies and chill, and drink wine... - I couldn't agree more. - ...and eat food. Yeah! Do you cook? - I do cook. - Okay. Would you make if we were on a date? Mm, I would probably make either salmon, - or I would make some peri chicken, rice. - Oh, yes. - There we go. Now we're talking. - Yeah. - Do you cook? - Yeah, I do cook. - I like a man who can cook. - Yeah? - Yeah. That's 'cause I like to eat. - I can cook for you. - So that's great. - Yeah. It's definitely interesting not seeing the man on the other side of the glass. They really have to get to know me and my tone and my personality outside of, ""Oh, she's cute, her breasts look good."" What are you really looking for in a partner? Somebody who is supportive, someone who's loving. I like when a guy hugs me from behind and makes me feel, like, small. Yeah, that's good. - Gosh, I want to get to know you more. - I know, I like you. I like you, too. I like your voice, too. You sound cute. When am I going to see you again? Soon as possible? - I'll talk to you soon, Lauren. - Bye, Cameron. Bye. My connection with Cameron is very strong, and I feel like I'm a good judge of character, so I'm feeling more comfortable. I'm feeling ready to just continue with this experiment and just meet more men. How's it going? Hello. Hello, hello. Hi. - Hello! - Hi! So, what are some of your biggest turn-offs? - Turn-offs? - Mm-hmm. Oh, my God. I hate, I hate, I hate being able to hear people breathe. What are you looking for in a woman? In shape, and beautiful. Oh, that doesn't sound shallow at all. If I had to guess, I'd say you're African-American. This is our first talk and you're already asking me what I look like? You're missing the point! What makes you think I'm African-American? Just your voice. Who cares what my complexion is? I'm a woman, that's all you need to worry about, that I don't have a penis. - Actually, no, I'm white. - Are you? I've only dated black men before, but honestly, I'm the type of person that I am attracted to personality. Not saying I want to marry Shrek or anything like that, but if Shrek had a good personality, I mean... My name is Amber Pike. I am 26, and I'm from Augusta, Georgia. A lot of people don't take me seriously because... I ain't ugly, so... And I've actually had a few people tell me that they were pleasantly surprised when they found out that I can hold an intellectual conversation. They're really shocked when they find out there's more to me than looking cute. Oh, God. Hi. Hey. Oh, God. I didn't know you were in here! - Nice snort. - God dang it. I've got to stop doing that! I told myself I wasn't gonna do that until the second or third date. - Well, it's cute, so... - Well, thank you. My name is Barnett. I'm 27 years old, and I live in Canton, Georgia. I'm excited to get to know someone based off of getting deep and down and dirty with them, emotionally. I'm Barnett. - Is that your first name or your last? - My last name. But my real close friends call me that. A lot of friends call me Pike. It's kind of an army thing, but they also did it in cheerleading. Okay, so you're in the army? - I was. - And you were a cheerleader? I enlisted in the Georgia Army Guard when I was 17. - I did eight years. - Oh, wow. I'm so used to, like, running with the boys. Like, I'm just so... off-the-wall crazy sometimes. Oh, gosh. Yeah, so... I always go for pretty girls. It's shallow to say, but it's the truth. I'm hoping this leads to something... more real, but this is different. I have no clue what any of them look like, so I'm like... I'm nervous, but I like talking, so... Do you want kids, Barnett? - Do I have kids? - Do you want kids? Oh, yeah, I do, but... Wait, do you have kids? - That's a question, too. - Not that I know of. I mean... I like it! Okay, okay. In the dating pod, I'm trying to see if they hang with my jokes and my personality. Are you clumsy? Generally, no. Lately, yes. What about in bed? Well, I ain't timid, that's for sure. I've never had sex. That's unfortunate. Next! The hardest part is not being able to see facial expressions. So I'm going to come off creepy to some of them, probably. Hello. Hey. So, what's your name? - I'm Jessica, what's yours? - ""Jessica."" My name is Barnett. I like it. All right, so I'm a big weirdo. What's the weirdest thing about you? Oh, I like this. Like, you would look at me and think that I would be... really girly, which I have that side of myself, for sure, but I actually dig sports and I definitely couldn't date a dude that wasn't into sports. - Ew. I hate sports. - You do not. I'm kidding. I played baseball my whole life. - Oh, cool! - So, yeah. - What position? - Like, what's my favorite position? Is that what you asked? I'm just kidding. I was a pitcher. That was amazing! I love that. So, you're witty. Alright, I see you. I see you over there. I have a serious question for you around intimacy. Ooh, yeah. What do you think about... dogs in the bed? I am one, but... No, I'm kidding. Oh, my God! My dog sleeps with me every night, so... - Really? - Yeah. I love that. Mine, too. Well, I'm just... I'm a big cuddler - and she knows it, so she just like... - I love that. Are you the big or little? What do you think? Probably the big. - Nope. - You're the little spoon? Your dog is just draped over you? - I'm getting a mental picture. - She puts a paw around me. I like Barnett's sexy voice and laugh a lot. I kind of like that he gave off a vibe that he was a player. We weren't necessarily getting deep, but there's an organic chemistry there. - It was nice talking to you. - It was nice talking to you, too. There was some good voices. I think Jessica had a nice voice. That's probably the sexiest. All these girls love my jokes, every single one of them. You know, ""Oh, next one laughed. There's my wife. All right."" It's like whoever I saw last is my number one. I've been going on date after date. I have absolutely experienced some instant connections, and my goal is to find out if there are any red flags, any deal breakers that are on my side or on her side. Have you ever had a dog? - I personally have not owned a dog. - Okay. Does that rule me out? No, as long as you would never yell at a dog. Who does that? Uh... People. You know, I'm here to find love, and it's going to take more than talking about dogs to do that. Jeez, I sound like an asshole. - What's your name? - My name is Diamond. Diamond? Okay. How you doing, Diamond? - That's my real name. - I was gonna... I heard it in your voice, questioning it. So, which strip club do you work at? I'm kidding! You know what? I knew you were going to say that. You're trying to lose points. Look, ""-5."" Hell, no! Barnett, uh-uh. Keep moving. A lot of girls will develop daddy issues in the form of, ""I need a man's attention."" Instead of turning into that, I became my own masculine influence in my life, I was a big tomboy, like, I wanted to work on cars. I wanted to build things and make things with my hands. I wanted to be a bad-ass. Hello? Oh, my God. That was so strange and awesome. Oh, my God. Who are y'all feeling? None of them, because it was through a wall. I totally have a favorite. Favorite, favorite, favorite. You don't want to compare favorites? I had one guy... What if we have the same favorite? I'm gonna fight you. My favorite was Barnett. He made me laugh so much. He's really sarcastic and perverted, and I'm like, yo... That's me, friends! Like, once you figure out who they are and who they are on the inside, do you feel like it doesn't matter what they look like? I feel like once you get to know someone, though, on that level, then they are more attractive to you. - Yes. I agree. - Yes. Yeah. Before coming here for this experience, I definitely judged a book by its cover. It was definitely based on a physical attraction first. I probably sound crazy saying this, but in less than 24 hours, I have found, like, honestly, probably three potential guys that I can see myself with for the rest of my life. Is anyone a virgin here? 'Cause, like, somebody asked me that. Really? - Are you a virgin? - I am. - Really? - Yeah. I am. Wow. So, how soon is too soon? If right here says now, - and says the same to her... - Sometimes right here is right here. My God. Every girl grows up waiting for their Prince Charming, and I want to make sure that this is it, that this is the one, and I'm willing to wait for it. What's the most times that you guys have had sex in one day or night? I would say four. Dang! - Is that a lot? - Lillie Mae! You wasn't in pain? Do you guys think it's important to go there sexually with someone before you marry her? That's a tough one. - That's the rest your life. - Yeah. Yeah. When it comes to marriage, a great sex life is important. I expect to be pleased as a man, and I expect to please her. But here, I'm trying to choose the person that I will spend the rest of my life with without even knowing what this person looks like. That's absolutely crazy. Does size matter, or is it the motion in the ocean? It's the size that matters, because there's no motion in any ocean without the thing that makes the motion go. - If it's very tiny... - Oh, my gosh. Why does it have to be very tiny? Like, damn! Very, very tiny, or... - Goodness Lord. - Oh, my gosh. What kind of traumatic experiences have you had? You've got to check it. You've got to put the snake back in the cage. Put it back in the case. Yes we are ♪ See the stars ♪ I wonder how the guys are doing. Wait, what do guys do when they can't play video games? ""Yo, bro, I bet I can do more push-ups than you."" - ""Go, bro."" - Oh, my God. Fifteen, 16... - Breathe! - ...17, 18, 19, 20. I can see that back just going... Now that you're all tired on that, now let's do a push-up competition. Yeah, I'll do it. My name is Carlton Morton. I'm 34 years old, and I'm from Opelousas, Louisiana. I had a good night's sleep, I'm ready to date, and it's time to start narrowing it down. Hello? Hey! You sound happy. I wish I could get that type of greeting every day. No, I'm just... You're so funny. I kid with you. So I want to know, what are some things that stand out about me to you? I wrote my notes down. I'm gonna get them out. Okay. Your personality's really good, you have morals and values. Love that you love to travel, 'cause I love to travel as well. You know I've never been to Vegas? - You've never been to Vegas? - Never. I can't wait to have that Vegas moment where I'm standing on tables, partying. I see where you're going to have your bachelor party. If you'll let me. Oh! What you mean, if I let you? Look, I've waited for the moment to fall in love for so long that I'm not messing nothing up. I am Diamond Jack, I am 28 years old, and I am from Chicago, Illinois. I know I am an attractive female, and I get a lot of attention from guys. Being a professional dancer, it has led to some ups and downs, especially in dating. There have been guys out there who only want to talk to me for my looks, or only want to talk to me because of what I do in life, and I want to be with someone who is going to really get to know me for who I am because, honestly, my mom didn't name me Diamond for nothing, she named me Diamond for a reason. That's the thing with relationships, you have to be able to trust. You're a totally different type of woman, and I appreciate that about you. If you were like, ""No, I don't want you to go to Vegas, 'cause last time this happened, - I don't feel comfortable."" - No, no, no. That's another thing about relationships: What's in the past needs to stay in the past. I'm not your ex-girl - who mistreated you or cheated on you. - Yeah. I'm a different person. I'm Diamond. I will want my king to have fun, live your life. - I like that. - So, go to Vegas, and tell me all about it! I feel like there's chemistry with Diamond. The way she talks to me, the way she makes me smile. I am so anxious to dive deeper in to see if she's the one. Would you want to go on another date? I will want to go on another date with you. You're trying to put on your sexy voice right now. I'm not! There are so many girls that I'm talking to, but Jessica and I have that emotional, strong bond. I would say you're the conversation I look forward to most. - Same. I... - You swear? Yeah, I promise you. Okay, that makes me feel so much better. I'm making so many connections with all the women that I'm talking to. Oh, yeah. What's up, LC? - What's up? - What's up, girl? The person that I talked to that was the coolest was you. I love that. - I had so much fun talking to you. - You're going to love me after this. It's weird how, like, these girls are fluctuating in my head. - Hello. - Hey, Barnett, it's Amber. Amber's scary. I really like her. I really like talking to her, but she's kind of a little scary for me. I was the first person to actually fire an AT4 round, and hit the tank. Like, hit the target and blow the tank up. - You're impressive as hell. - I know! Golly. Trust me, a lack of confidence is not a weakness of mine. - Are you having a good night? - Yeah. - It's better now. - Good. I think Jessica could be wife material. I don't understand how she could be single at 34. There's got to be something wrong, right? I haven't found anything wrong yet, and I'm trying. I know everybody wants kids and stuff like that, so, like, once we get married, can we go ahead and start or do we need to wait a year? Do we need to get to know each other even more for the next year? I could totally... I'm not on a timeline. Okay. That's what I was wondering, like... No, look, like... I want to make sure that you're not here just to start a family. I want to make sure. Okay, look, listen up. I'm a fucking catch over here. I'm a fucking catch. I don't need your sperm. I knew you were LC by your voice. You have a beautiful voice. A few guys have told me I have a great voice. Dang it, I wasn't the first one to say that. If I had a wife, I'd want her to be happy, free-spirited willing to be adventurous, and I think that is one of the reasons that LC's been top of my list. How tired are you of getting the marriage questions? - I haven't really gotten any marriage... - Really? - You want to get married? - Sure, let's do it. - Alright, cool. - That was super easy. I guess we can go now. I'm LC. I'm 26 and I'm from Tampa, Florida. I definitely want to get married. Who doesn't want to feel loved? Like, that's just a basic human necessity. If you say you don't want it, you're a liar. Go to therapy. Like... I'm not going to look as nice as anybody else that would propose to you. But I'm the only one wearing shorts. I'm wearing ripped high-waisted jeans. I've never been a fan of high-waisted pants. Don't waste a perfectly good ass. You're so forward, Barnett! You know what I'm into. - Hello. - Hi, Cameron. Oh, I'm so happy it's you. I'm happy it's you. I was really looking forward to talking to you again. I was looking forward to talking to you. How are you feeling right now? Tell me. I'm feeling like I had a few connections. I don't know if I should admit this, but I felt the strongest connection with you. Oh, I felt a strong connection with you, too. Good, I hope so. What was it that really drew you to me? That your vibe is great. Like, I just feel a good chemistry with you, like a connection. - It doesn't feel forced. - Right. So, now you tell me, what's the most important attribute of... I guess that you want in your wife? Someone who's not afraid to tell me things that are difficult. Someone who understands the type of person that I am, because I think that I'm kind of unusual in some ways, being a scientist but also... I worked as a firefighter for, like, seven years. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. I feel like I'm also a pretty sensitive guy, which can be good or bad. I appreciate a man who has sensitivity. What's the last thing that you cried about? My mom was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. So it's just some of the difficult things with my mom. I understand. I'm really sensitive about my family, too. Sometimes I just love my family so much. I feel the same way. Oh, my God, I'm getting emotional. Yeah, I'm getting a little emotional. Wow, gosh. Oh, Cameron, I wish I could hug you. - I would really love that. - I know. I know. I have never talked this much about emotions in my life. Like, it makes such a huge difference when there are no distractions. Like, there's no phones, no text messages, no worrying about what people think or how we look. I mean, I'm sitting here, crying with a man who I've never seen before. And it's day two. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - You look happy. I know I do. - I think I found one. - What? We freaking cried together today, guys. - What? - Wait, why? Tell me more. Today? Yeah. So, we were just talking about our family, and then we were both like, ""We're getting emotional."" He's like, ""Me too,"" and it was just like... We were just crying about how much we love our families! - That is sweet! - I was just like, ""Oh, my God, - I'm really crying right now!"" - That is so sweet! - I know, I thought so, too. - I love it. I can't believe I just cried in a pod on a date. In a freaking pod. You cried in a pod! So is he your number one choice right now? Yeah, he is, for sure. There's never been a time in my life when I've been able to really focus solely on finding love. Here in the experiment, you spend every second of every minute searching for your soulmate. How's your day going so far? I had four hours of dates! Yeah. I have talked so much. I was looking forward to seeing you. Me, too. We talk about so much stuff, but then we don't ask the big questions, you know? Yeah, so, okay. So, this one... Okay, let's do this. This date, we'll dedicate to asking the big questions. Totally. My last serious relationship was with a guy who was 41. At that point in my life, I felt like I was fast-forwarding my life a bit. Is that what you're worried that I'm feeling about you? Yeah, I feel like you will be in that position with me, probably. Don't let that be something that's sitting there being a block on you. Okay, I just want to be realistic. She's 34, I'm 24. I don't care. To me, age is a mindset. Like, integrity is everything to me. I'm definitely... super... Christian. Holy shit, we're the same fucking version. It's like, I want to raise my kids with religion, Christianity, and, you know, be very... - Because that's how I was raised. - Yeah. And, you know, I have a tattoo on my ribs, like, it's a cross with my parents' initials on the top and bottom. My sister, my brother... ...on an empty plaque, so when I have kids I can initial their names in it, and Psalm 19:14 going across it. I love that. That makes me happy. - How many kids do you want? - Three. - Three? I'm down. - Okay. I want two boys and a girl. I like that. My face hurts. - Why? - I'm smiling a lot. - You are? - Maybe. That makes me so happy. I'm learning things about myself, and I'm realizing there are things I'm looking for - that I didn't know I was looking for. - Exactly. So, this set of guidelines that I came in with... ""Oh, you know, I want someone between these ages, and somebody who's into this."" The guy that I'm into - meets zero of those criteria! - Who knows? Today, Mark told me that he has a tattoo of a cross on his chest, and he has two openings for his kids. Oh! And, like, I want to be a mom more than anything, too, and for me to know that somebody's ready for that kind of a thing... I've never had those type of discussions with anyone. It's overwhelming. For me, that age gap had to be, like, the most real, Love at first s... - Talk? - ...voice? I would have never guessed that I would've developed the feelings that I'm feeling in a couple of days. Mark and I are really creating a true soul connection, but sometimes I snap back to reality and think about, what are my friends going to think, what are my parents going to think? Mark is... five years younger than my baby brother, who's five years younger than me. Alright, boys. - Hello. - Hello. What's up, Jessica? - What are you doing over there? - Nothing. I just got here. Jessica, I really enjoy talking to. She's just so freaking cool. So if we were married, what would you want your husband to be doing - when you came home? - I like this question. It doesn't have to be anything special, but just to come home and have... you to hang out with on the couch. Yeah. Just, like, arms. Yeah. Arms. Even if you've had a stressful day, I just want you to look at me and be like, ""I'm just so happy to see him."" ""You brighten up when you see me."" That's all I want. - That's exactly what I'm looking for. - Yeah. I work really, really hard. Having something to come home to is, like, the goal. I have never asked anyone how they would be as a husband, but discussing that today with Barnett, I thought was the hottest thing ever. After a couple of conversations with Mark I decided, you know, this is my guy, but now I'm questioning that a little bit because I'm having these really intense feelings for Barnett. At this point, I can see them both being my husband, which is crazy. Being here is something that is so extremely surreal and unlike anything I've ever experienced before. Things that happen in a day here may take months or longer outside. It's a roller coaster ride of emotions. How are you? Oh! So much better now. I've been thinking about you nonstop. - Obviously. - I've been thinking about you, too. I've been talking about you. Like crazy. I love that. I've been, like, trying to imagine you. Obviously that's... kind of impossible, but... It is. In my mind it's almost like you can see me, but obviously you can't. I'm just thinking, ""I have to look good for her."" - But it's like, it's weird. - Aww. You say all the right stuff. But it's true, though. It's true. - Cameron... - Yes? I think I love you. I love you. Wow. I love you. I love you! Did we just say that? Yeah. Oh, I can't breathe. Okay. Are you crying? Just a tiny bit. It's all becoming, very very real. I've fallen in love with her without ever having seen her. Part of me does think, ""Are you being rash?"" But it feels so right. It feels like I'm jumping out of a plane. Scary as fuck. - Yeah. - But amazing. It is scary. But I trust you. I trust you. If we get married, then, you know, that's it for me. - Yeah, me, too. - We have to make it work. We do. Yeah. It's terrifying, thinking that something that I've been looking for my whole life could possibly be with the person that's on the other side of that wall. I feel like I'm falling in love with a stranger, but, at the same time, I feel like I know everything about him. I wish that I could... just kinda hold you right now. Yeah. Me, too. You're, like, four feet away. But I'm right here. Yeah, you're here. I know. Hey, what's up, Diamond? I've been waiting for you. Aww. I've been waiting for you, too. - I want to learn more about you. - What do you want to know? - What do you want to learn? - Your true, deepest, darkest fears as it relates to marrying someone. I like the fact that he cannot see me. I like the fact that Carlton is really getting a chance to know me. I really like when he opens up to me. I think it shows that he trusts me, it shows that he is safe with me. It makes me feel like these are the words I've been missing from a man. My fear is getting hurt. I have been vulnerable, and, in my past relationships, I felt like I was giving my all and trying to make that person happy. At the end of the day, I didn't, and that's why I'm here. I want to be happy. I don't want to be disappointed, - and I don't want to be embarrassed. - Right. I've been taught to be strong, I've been taught not to cry, I've been taught to... You know, I come from a strong cloth. Yeah. How do you think I feel? It's like, ""boys don't cry!"" Like, that's constantly conditioned in black men's heads since we were boys. I know. I have had to learn how to open up, and it's okay to... be sensitive and emotional and vulnerable. I'm a preacher's kid, and because I'm so outgoing, I'm so outspoken, people see me and they say, ""Oh, he must not be insecure about anything."" But sometimes, on the inside, I haven't always felt that confident, and I've always been this hopeless romantic. I want to be loved for who I truly am. Unconditionally, and without restraint. Wow, that's deep. My biggest dream is that I finally find a wife who will love me unconditionally, who's kind of like that ride or die. But I have a big secret. At one point in my young adult life, I found myself attracted to just hearts, period. Like, it didn't have a gender. It wasn't about sex for me. I dated guys and girls. But I want a wife now, because I feel like women bring a certain, like, nurturing love and affection to the table that, like, I don't get from a guy. My biggest worry is that I will find someone that I am super in love with and want to marry, and then, at the last minute, she will not be able to walk down the aisle because she just can't be married to someone like me. What's up? I'm the happiest I've been in a very long time. It's not everything, but I'm on cloud nine. Jessica. I need a... ...drink. I'm the type of person that can feel vibes and situations, and I'm feeling a shift in Barnett. And I realize that, yeah, he's into Jessica. - Is this too much? - It's too little. Why do you leave so much air up top? That is out of my control. I came into this being open-minded to the idea that I could possibly find love. What's exciting is that I feel like I've found a person I could spend the rest of my life with in a very short period of time, and that's Jessica. I want you to know something. I don't let a lot of people in my heart a lot. Um... I shut down, and I think I've always been like that. When I walked in the room from the first time I met you, I knew... It was just like, I was blown... I don't know how to explain it, but I walked around the right side of the couch, turned the corner, and you said, ""Hey,"" and I was like, ""Yep, that's it."" I don't understand why. I tried to press the brakes, but you're the first person that's ever really gotten me. You're the cutest thing ever, by the way. - What do you mean? - I just love when you get so passionate. What do you mean? Ahh, I just want to hug you. Kind of everything you say, beyond anything I could have expected. Like... it was just mind-blowing. You know, my last girlfriend, I had my heart broken and stuff. And, um... You know, I had gotten cheated on and whatever, but it took this experience to really just break down any kind of wall that I thought I had about my heart. And... when I tell you, I really don't open up like how I am with you to anybody, like... I... You know, I... God. Um... I want you. You know, I ask you, you know... Do you want to spend the rest your life with me? Like, where's your mind at? We've come a really long way in a matter of days, not weeks, and... like, I can definitely... see us walking out of here together. I really can. It's kind of weird to say that. That's what I'm talking about! Whoo! That's the cutest. I want to spend the rest of my life with a real partner, and I couldn't be more ready to do that with Jessica. I'm all in. - We'll talk soon. - OK. Alright, bye. I think today was the biggest checkpoint of this entire thing. - Yeah. Of course. - Like, ""Fuck, this is real."" Like... Things like emotions are starting to come into play for Jessica, and then, like, real stories were going underneath the surface. It's all here now. - Who's your number one? - Don't worry about it. It's stressful thinking that other people have any connection with someone that you thought you had a really good connection with. Jessica? There it is. It's Jessica. But... Mark's over here, he's super excited about her. Mark is a passionate guy, and he's excited about Jessica a lot. And he's 24, and she's 34. I don't know if... I don't know if he's ready. I don't know if he's ready. The problem is, I haven't gotten really deep or emotional with her yet. - I've gotten a little bit... - Now's your chance, man. I'm nervous about... being myself and and getting hurt, and hurting people, so... I'm also... I'm afraid of opening up and losing that connection. Tell her how you feel, tell her what's going on, break down the emotional and give everything you've got, because the pain of knowing you didn't give it all and you'll never know the answer is terrible, and you should avoid that at all costs. Just do it. This has made me so open, I feel like. I actually am with you on that. - Like I enjoy how... - I enjoy it. Yeah, we get to the essence of each other and it's not like, ""Oh, I'm blinded by his blue eyes."" - Yeah. - You know what I'm saying? It's like, this is really what I want, and laying it all on the line. You tell me who you are, honestly, and I'll tell you who I am, honestly, and if you accept it, you do. - And if don't, you're just not for me. - Not for me, yeah. Yeah, this has definitely changed my life. Five days in and I know who I want to be my future husband. I can't believe it. It's only been five days! Oh, my God, I've had meals in my refrigerator for longer than that. Like, that's crazy. I've spent every second of this experiment focusing on finding my wife, and I think I've found her. I feel immense attraction to her, and I've never seen her before. I know Lauren is the one, and I don't need to do any more searching. I'm ready to propose to Lauren. - Hello? - Hello. I'm happy to hear your voice. I'm very happy to hear your voice. Are you sitting down, or are you standing up? I'm sitting down. Do you want to... approach the wall? Yeah. - Come up to the wall? - Uh-huh. Okay. Lauren Michelle Speed... Holy shit. I feel so blessed to have you come into my life. I love you so much, and I want to... spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Oh, my God, yes. Yes, Cameron, I will marry you, I will be your wife! I feel like I'm in a dream right now. I feel like I'm floating. We're engaged. We're engaged! This literally feels like... like a fairy tale. You're such a beautiful person. I don't have to see you to say that. - You're my future husband. - You're my future wife. Holy shit! - I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye! Tomorrow I finally get to see Cameron in person for the first time. I get to look him in the eyes and grab his face and kiss it. I'm super excited to just meet this man who I've fallen in love with, finally. I'm engaged! She said yes. Oh, my God! For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ Pick him up! I never thought I would create one connection, let alone two. I don't know where these guys came from. You know, Mark is everything I've ever wanted, and he wants to walk away from this being married, and it's hard for me to accept that... he feels that way for me. Something in the back of my mind is like, ""Can this really work in the real world?"" Our age difference is massive, and the fact that my relationship with Barnett has progressed so much in the matter of a couple of days, I have to see what happens with Barnett. Hey, B. - What's up, girl? - What you doing? Just chilling. How you feeling? I feel really happy that you're my last date tonight. I know who Jessica is still interacting with, and I know how they feel towards her. It's like, is she telling everybody the same thing? That's actually a big fear I have right now. I don't want to throw my heart out there and just like... actually be, you know, hurt. Don't blow smoke up my ass real quick. Are you mad at me? Are you mad at me right now? No. Talk to me. Oh, gosh. I'm going through so much turmoil right now. Why? Let me say something. I feel like you don't know where my head is. Literally, I think... What? You just got done with Mark. I knew that he had just left with you. He was so sure of everything, and that scared me. As soon as I saw that, I was like... maybe she's just been kind of just... She wasn't feeling the way I was feeling. You don't think I hear things on the other side? There's multiple girls that really like you, but the girls don't think you're serious about them. And literally, like, the military girl is going to kick my ass, I know it. Like, don't make this one-sided. Jessica, Jessica, Jessica... - What? - Hmm? - What? - You've been high on my list since the beginning. If this place had nobody, no other guys and no other girls, like, I would propose to you tomorrow. You would? You are my yin to my yang. I am so fucking happy right now. I'm 34 years old and no one has ever said those words to me, that they're ready to propose, that they want to walk out of here being married to me. Barnett just changed everything, and I think I would say yes. - Um, what do you need me to do? - What do I need you to do? I'll do whatever you want me to do. If you want me to pull the plug on those other things tomorrow, I will. I just want... I want a clear decision made. Okay. All right. Yesterday, Cameron and I got engaged. He asked me to be his wife! I have a fiancé, y'all! Oh, my God. I'm gonna be a married woman. I'm so excited. Okay. And today I finally get to see him in person for the first time. I'm super excited to just meet this man who I've fallen in love with. Of course I'm excited to see what she looks like. I've tried to just kind of leave it as a blank slate, so that, you know, however she looks I want to appreciate that. Throughout this process, I wasn't focused on what the person looked like. I wasn't focused on their race, if they were white or black. I wasn't focused on, you know, if they're too young or too old. But now that I'm here, I'm scared, because what if he doesn't like how I look? What if I don't like how he looks? She's maybe feeling the same way I'm feeling right now, which is a little crazy, a little nervous, a little bit nauseous. There is a chance that, by the end of this, he may not feel the same, and, to me, that's terrifying. I can't breathe. It's just scary. It's just frightening. That's all. As the diligent scientist that I am, I came into this wanting to test that hypothesis: is love blind? So... it's a success! I've met the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. And I have no idea what she looks like. Oh, God. I'm 100% in love. And it didn't come from seeing someone across the room. who I thought was hot. It came from really connecting with someone on a deeper level than I've ever experienced before. Shit, I'm nervous as hell. I don't know if I'm gonna laugh, cry or pass out. Oh, my God. - Fuck. - It's giving me butterflies. Baby! Holy shit, that's my fiancée. He was definitely not what I expected. I've made a huge mistake. When you really fall in love with someone, the physical attraction builds. You're not gonna let me go, are you? The physical connection is absolutely there. I wouldn't change anything about him. Moving in with my fiancé is gonna be another adventure. - I'm always cleaning the place. - Heard that before. Why are you marrying my daughter? Have you ever been in a room full of black people? I can't lose a love like this again. It would destroy me. I was fucking honest. I didn't fucking deceive nobody. You were so confused a week ago. I want to make sure that you're doing what's right for you. Listen to me! Stop interrupting me, please, for the love of God. We're gonna go back and look at this, and be like, ""Did I make the right choice?"" Fuck you! Fuck you! Fucker! Do I want to marry him? I don't know. Marriage is forever. The stakes are high. This isn't just some fantasy. This is the rest of our lives. White or black, tall or short, too young or too old... I always wanted to believe that love is blind. Today, we're here to discover if love is blind. Do you take him to be your lawful wedded husband? I don't know if I can go through with this wedding. I cannot do this! Please stop recording this."
Love Is Blind,01,02,"I never expected, walking into this facility... that I would find my wife and mean that, but here we are. Everything has just been building up to this moment, to meet this man who I feel like fell out of the sky. I feel like he was made in a factory, like he was specifically put together for me. I think I'm just a little nervous about seeing her for the first time, physically. I hope that, you know, her expectations aren't let down. I don't think they will be, but, you know, you just never know, when you add in that physical element, how that might change things. When we're in the pods, we don't have to think about how we look physically, because they can't see us. So right now, I'm like, oh my God, what if a piece of my hair's sticking up, I can't have bad breath. What if I'm sweating? I'm just anticipating the moment of getting to physically see him, and I'm a nervous wreck. But I'm ready. Oh, my gosh. Cameron! - I'm so excited to see you. - I'm excited, too. I'm never going to let you go. I hope not. I promise you. I cannot wait to marry you. Mm. I feel like this environment has allowed me to date outside my race, without even knowing, mainly because Cameron and I's connection was so strong that I really didn't care what color he was. It just turns out that he was white. Let me look at you. - You're so handsome. - You're beautiful. I can't believe how beautiful you are. Oh... You're so handsome. You literally look like a prince. Like Prince Charming. Lauren... will you still marry me? Of course, yes. To figure it out ♪ Pretty. Gorgeous. Sometimes it’s all wrong ♪ where you belong ♪ I'm strong. You are strong. It doesn't even seem like she's real because it seems too perfect. I couldn't be happier. How did I get so lucky? How did I get so lucky? You're real. Just hold me. Oh, my gosh. I'm going to take care of you. And you're strong. This is my first time kissing a white man. I have large, full lips, and I was scared that the proportion was going to be like, ""Oh, my God, my lips are going to be a lot for his smaller lips,"" but he is an excellent kisser. - See you soon. - Okay. Honestly, our journey is just beginning. Obviously, we have our emotional connection, and now we are going to be whisked away on a beautiful, tropical romantic vacation to Mexico. I can't wait to just sit with him on the beach, and watch the sunset and sunrise, and drink frozen drinks, and take advantage of him. It's a dream, being able to touch her, and smell her perfume, and to know that I'm not just in love with how gorgeous she is, but the person that she is. I'm very vocal about the struggles of black people, and in the back of my mind, I am thinking a lot of my friends or peers will be like, ""Wow, Lauren, you going to go marry a white man?"" But, at the end of the day, I feel like I can still want the best for black people. I can still want black people to win. I can still voice my opinions about how black people are treated in this country, and still love who I love. Being in an interracial relationship will be difficult. but I feel pretty confident that we'll be able to take on this, uh, mean world that's out there. Us against the world. I'm pouring us glasses of wine. Because we're classy. ""Wine"" not? Before coming into this facility, I was very superficial. I had to be with a supermodel. I had to be with a beauty queen. Now, I'm ready to focus on what matters. It's more about what's on the inside. If that heart is beautiful, if your soul speaks to my soul. Have you guys tried to imagine the faces of the people you're talking to? Yeah, of course. I can't. Every single one. I can imagine the body types, based off what they say they're interested in, like their activity level, the stuff they do, their hobbies. But I can't see their faces. People here are falling in love through a wall. It's a crazy kind of magic, but it works. With Damian, I was like... He joked he was like, ""I'm 5'4"". I'm like, ""I wouldn't care"". Like, I'm obsessed with you. Whatever woman you end up with, Damian, is gonna be one lucky lady. To the rest of our lives. - Cheers. - Happy. - Hello? - Who is it? It's Damian. Thank God. I couldn't stop thinking about you today. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. You got my butterflies turning. Get out of here, little guys. Get out. You know, it's so funny, we're going on our fifth date, I believe? - Fourth or fifth. - Wow. Yeah. We're sliding into each others DM's, I guess. I love that. You got a really cute sense of humor, and I'm really digging that, really hard. Thanks, I'm silly. Yeah, I like that a lot. My name is Giannina Gibelli, and I'm 25 years old. I'm from Venezuela. Caracas, Venezuela. Growing up, I was always, like, the sweet one. My mom called me her dulce de leche. I taught myself English by reading. My mom told me that she would always take me to bed, and like, I would have a book on my chest every single time. You've given me nothing, but like, I guess, ""vibe"" always sounds like such a weird word, but... No, use the word ""vibes."" Alright, so you've given me really good vibes, and I'm actually sitting on the carpet right now... I'm literally so close to the screen... Are you really? I'm literally sitting on the carpet right now, criss-crossed legs. - Me, too. - Just chilling, looking at it. Me, too. What's important to you? Uh, my family. - Right. - Yeah, my family for sure. But, you know, I want to carry that on. I want to have a family of my own someday, and I want somebody to walk by my side, not to walk in front of. I adore that. Yeah. It's become so easy to talk to you, and I've... And I'm really starting to emotionally connect with you. I'm Damian Powers, and I'm 27 years old. I came into this process not knowing what to expect, no matter how good-looking we are, or what type of body we have, we all want to be loved, we all want to be accepted. I want to find someone that just loves me and accepts me for everything that I am, and everything that I'm not. I'm really hoping to get to know you more over these next few days. I like you. I like you a lot. Yeah, I like you, too. I know Diamond, and I've fallen in love with this woman. I feel very free. I feel comforted in knowing that no matter what I've been through, no matter who I currently am, that there's someone that just wants to weather the storm together. That's what I deserve, and... it's amazing. Hello. - Hey. - Hey, baby. Through this whole week spent with Carlton, I feel safe. I've never connected with someone on this level. I have waited for this my whole life, and I can't waste any more time. - Diamond? - Yes? Will you be my wife? Oh, my gosh. Will you marry me? Oh, my gosh. - Yes. - You will? Yes. Baby! My dad passed away when I was a very young girl. I remember going to the funeral, and I see ladybugs everywhere I went. Today, I woke up, and I literally seen a ladybug, on the mirror. I really thought that was my dad talking to me, reminding me that everything is going to be okay. Carlton is the man I've been praying for. Yeah. And I think everything is going to be okay. Don't cry. I got you. I got you forever. I'm never going to break your heart. I just wanna, like, bust through the glass, and just, like, hug you. Let's do this, babe. Let's get it. I have found my forever and I'm not letting any doubt, any insecurities from the past ruin this for me, because it's the best I've ever felt in my life, and no one can take that away from me. I love you. I love you, too. With all my heart. Oh, God. You know I can't breathe, right? I can't either. Like, it's a lot. You've taught me so much in such a short period of time. It just became evident, day-by-day, that there was no fears, just feeling like I could be myself with you, and no matter what I tell you, you'd accept me, and not leave me, because I feel that I've been left many times. And I found myself thanking God for you. You make me feel like I won't have to hide anything. I won't have to be anybody other than Carlton. I can't see my life without you, at this point. I think God put you in my life for a reason. I think you are a phenomenal person. Throughout this whole process, we have been vulnerable, and you inspire me. I'm like, shaking. It's crazy. It's very touchy to decide when to reveal my sexuality to Diamond, because I'm just not sure how she'll handle it. Going through this experience in such a short amount of time, I'm definitely closer, and I have to be ready to reveal this information. I just... don't think that I can do it right now. I have experienced rejection in the past by people that I thought would understand, so I am afraid to ruin this. My whole life, I've just been... craving acceptance. I'm going to make an amazing husband. I'm going to be a great father. Oh, gosh. This is one of the happiest days of my life. you've been dreaming of ♪ Hello. Kelly. What's up? My name is Kelly Chase. I'm 33 years old, and the dating scene for me, it's just never been right. I had gained about 40 pounds a few years ago, and I am just still not where I would like to be. And then I'm like, ""Kelly, someone out there thinks you're beautiful the way you are."" I'm going to to sit down. - Yeah. - See if we can get real personal. I'm Kenny Barnes. I'm 27 years old, and I've had great experiences with past relationships, but there's always that missing link. I've had a tough time with putting myself out there to be vulnerable, and truly be valued. So one of the biggest things that I've had a problem with is wanting to feel accepted. So that's what I'm looking for. Did you have a favorite childhood book? I had a couple. There's a book... It was about a mom and her son. - Yes. - It was a little picture book, and it was like, ""Forever my baby you will be..."" - Yes! - I'm getting chills. Oh my God, I love it. It was my favorite childhood book, and obviously I'm not a son, but my mom read it to my sister and I. Oh, my God. Like, it is 100 percent my favorite book. Holy smokes. That hit me pretty good. Aww! To be honest with you, I read it three or four years ago, and I was going through a transitional phase. I just started with the company I'm with now, and it's kind of like that moment of reflection, like, things are great, - but they're not where I want them to be. - Right. Personally, I have felt recently... It's like I felt like I had no one to talk to. - Yeah. - It's like, there's work, and I'm stressed out about that. Let alone, it's family, you know, stuff that's going on... It's like I can't talk to anyone. I literally can't talk to anyone. - Yeah. - Can't talk. Yeah, you do, you feel alone. Yeah, and it's funny... Not ""funny"" you mention that, but, for, like, months, I have felt very, um, alone. For like months. And, excuse me for crying... You okay? Yeah, yeah... But no, I just like... - I want to give you a hug right now. - I know, sorry. No, it's okay. I'm a... I, I, I get it. And, like, oh my gosh. So you got me with the book, and... I told you I'm not a crier, but I feel it, right? Yeah. I love when guys cry. Kenny can get emotional, and I was just like, ""Okay, I love you"". Yeah. I've wanted... a best friend for a while now. I appreciate that you're willing to open up like that. Yeah. With Barnett, it's just so weird, and it's getting hard, because I'm having conversations that I'm literally, like, I'm talking to him, and I was like, ""If we do this, if we're together, there's something I wanna do, as husband and wife, like, this is what I want to do in a relationship."" Like talking, like when this works, - I want us to get a couple's massage... - Yeah. In my mind, it's not even a question. - What's not a question? - Like... that we would be a couple. It's not a question. I know the other girls have feelings for Barnett, but... it's Barnett or bust, for me at this point. These girls will be at my wedding. There's gonna be a wedding, and they'll be there. I'm sorry, it's gonna happen. So, sucks to be them. He doesn't approach it, or the way that he responds to it is not like... It's not like a weird way like, ""Oh, yeah, 'if'..."" He doesn't accentuate it, he was like, ""Yeah. When we get through this, we'll get a couples massage."" That sounds pretty affirmative. Like, all my cards are on the table. I literally have nothing left to play. Just waiting for him to make the moves. Mm-hmm. Hearing Amber talk about Barnett, doesn't really phase me. I know what Barnett and I have is special, and totally different from what he has with her, because we always talk about what life would be like after this, and it's kind of a secret between us that we're going to end up together in this. The easy stuff comes so easy. It's just Barnett or bust, that's it for me. Yeah. We have two weeks to figure out who we're going to spend the rest of our lives with. I've got three people left. Jessica, Amber, and LC, they all would make excellent wives, and it's difficult because I'm becoming emotionally attached to all of them in different ways. What's up, LC? Do you really think that you can find a wife? What do you think? Don't do that. We don't have time for games here. The thing with Barnett is, we can paint a really good picture together, like... what this would actually be like, what an actual life with each other would look like. I'm just really pumped to see what happens the next few days. Why do you think you could marry me? I don't know, I've always envisioned myself with a guy similar to my dad in the way he like... - Oh, gosh. - ...he's a people person, everybody loves him. How do you imagine I would do with your parents? - I think you'd be good with my parents. - Yeah? I don't know if Barnett will propose to anyone, but I feel like if he did, I think that it would be me. Okay, real quick, whenever I propose, What do you think about non-diamond rings? - Oh, yeah. I love that. - Really? Okay. Alright, well, you gotta do it. Yeah? Yep. With LC, we're very freaking similar, and it's like, what's going on here? Like, why are we so alike? It's like figuring out if I want to marry myself in girl version. So... With Amber, she excites me, but she also scares the living hell out of me. When we get out of here, we're going to be all, like, engaged and shit. ""We're all gonna be engaged""? You're talking in general, or you and me are gonna be engaged? Me and you. Are you proposing to me now? Is that a thing? No, I'm not going to propose you tonight. If I don't propose to Amber, she's going to find me outside of here and whoop my ass! Hey, B. Hey, girl. I think Jessica is my number one, because every time I talk to her, there's like mad goosebumps. I told her I was ready to get married, and I would choose her if I could. If this place had no other guys, and no other girls, I would propose to you tomorrow. You would? You are my yin to my yang. I am so fucking happy right now. Jessica, Amber and LC... I love everything about these girls, but all in different ways, and I'm like, ""What the hell am I supposed to do?"" You got it? You getting married? No. Not yet. - Not yet? - Not yet. What you doing? - I'm just a little nervous. - Nervous of what? My relationship with Barnett, like... - went somewhere I've never really felt. - Really? I've never felt before. We just started to talk really seriously, and he started talking in the context of being my husband, and I started to visualize it. I've waited so long for, like, someone that I care about so much to say those things, and to feel that way. He said he would marry me. Oh, wow. I had an awkward moment with Barnett, and I just never gave him another chance. He pretty much associated my name with being a stripper, and so when girls be mentioning him, I'll be like, ""Oh my God. What is it?"" I'm like, I couldn't stand him. Like, ugh. And then, like, I know the feelings that I have for Mark, and it's just a totally different relationship. Like, it's... amazing on so many levels. Mm-hmm. Jessica, since the first day you walked out that pod, and you was like, ""Girl."" I said, ""What?"" ""I like Mark."" And I'm like, ""Oh!"" Just know, if you're asking me my advice, I prefer for you to be with Mark. I'm nervous about Mark, though. My relationship with Barnett, and my relationship with Mark are totally separate, like ""on another planet"" type relationships. You know, I always thought... my relationship with Barnett was just a flirtatious situation. And now that it's developing into more, I have to see what happens with Barnett. I have to follow my heart with Barnett. It's a breath of fresh air to be accepted by Jessica for just me. Not what I look like, not how I move, or my body, or whatever. It's like she's accepting me for me. And now I know what a true relationship looks like. You know, I ask you... you know, do you want to spend the rest of your life with me? Like... where's your mind at? I can definitely... see us walking out of here together. I really can. It's kind of weird to say that. That's what I'm talking about! I think Jessica and I, will be getting married. So what's up? I'm sad right now. Why? Because I don't like this situation anymore. What are you talking about? I feel like I'd rather just walk away from this. This is crazy. So many people are going to get hurt in this, you know? I don't want you to like, hurt. Why... What are you talking about? Obviously since day one, I've been like, Mark, Mark, Mark. That's just been it, you know? You know, our connection is so strong, but I would be doing myself a disservice if I didn't... pursue relationships like I came here to do. What the fuck? I get it, you want to weigh out all your options and be certain. I am certain. You were certain when you walked out yesterday. I definitely don't want to jump the gun, you know? It's just the experience for me has been different. It's worked in different ways for me. And I don't just care about you, like I... I love you, like, it's crazy. All the other dates I've had, I didn't feel like that. The reason why I'm so passionate right now is because I feel that towards you, but if you're feeling that with someone else, it's like... I will... I'm going to be open and honest with you. Okay. You're ten years younger than I am. Like, it's, it's... crazy. Like I have created other connections that... look like they could potentially plug into my life, you know? I'm just trying to, like, explore everything, because we only have a limited amount of time and it's like the rest of our lives, you know what I mean? It feels like I'm an option, that's what it makes me feel like. God... I told you how certain I am. I've never been this certain about something in my life. I'm going to tell you straight up. If I'm not walking out of here with you, then I'll go my separate way, and I'll go home. And that's fine. I'm just letting you know where I stand, and that the ball's in your court, and that's all I'm saying. I came into this wanting to find someone, but I didn't know that I was going to have to hurt someone else, too. So I think that's wearing on me more than anything. Oh, fuck me! Yesterday, I felt like we both knew that we were going to walk - out of here together. - Yeah. Today, having conversations, as you said, I'm just like, ""So you're playing me? So you're still weighing your options, - or what's up?"" - Yeah. Because that's the problem. Because, like, I'm not just a fucking option. I don't need my partner, age difference or not, to expect me to be a 34 year old. I'm 24. I know what I am. I feel as though I put my heart out there, and someone reciprocated it, but then just ripped it out for no reason. Don't fuck with me. - Don't fuck with me. - Yeah. - I'm a grown-ass man. - Yeah. - I know what I fucking want. - Yeah. Oh, fuck me. I'm about to see the man of my dreams for the first time. He assured me that I will always make him happy, no matter what. I just hope that he accepts me for who I am. I'm here for you, Carlton. I will always be here for you, no matter what. Oh, my gosh. I didn't tell Diamond about my past before the proposal, because I just always wanted people to judge me for the way that I love, rather than who I love, and a lot of times, people are misjudged when they're fluid. So, of course in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, well, what if she has a change of heart? When we finally meet, I just hope that I make him smile. And I hope that he just finds me very attractive, and... will swoop me up and take me off. How are you? Hi! Oh, my God. Oh, wow. How are you? - I'm good, how you feeling? - Good. Oh my gosh. I'm a fiancée! Can you believe it? Look at you. Look at you! Look at you. You fly. - You look good. Thank you. - Damn. - I was hoping you'd like it. I know that I'm different. I know that my past is different. But this is what I've always dreamed of. In four weeks, we'll be getting married. My biggest worry is that someone that I am super in love with and want to marry, won't be able to walk down the aisle, because she just can't be married to someone like me. I'm excited about my marriage. - I am. - You are? Mm-hmm. You ready to get this party started? I am. It's going to be great. I love guys with bald heads, and I think I like the way he dressed, and just his whole persona. I'm very attracted to Carlton. Whoo! Thank you, God. When I was talking to him, expressing my heart to him, I wanted to know, like, are you here for me? Are you going to accept my flaws? Carlton has a way of making me feel like I'm the only woman on Earth. He really, truly, loves me. As of right now, the only concern will have to be our family. Hopefully our family can accept our love, and the way it went down. This is not normal. I know a lot of families are traditional. They want you to date, become the girlfriend... We're not oblivious to the steps and the process of marriage, but it's not their life. It's my life, and I choose to be with Carlton. You should be proud about the fact that so many girls like you. You are a catch, my brother. Who have you talked the most with on serious issues? - Amber. - Amber. Probably Amber. What about Jessica? I think we shoot the shit way too much when we're in there, and it's hard to get past that sometimes. Why was she your number one last night? Like, the feeling in the moment. I mean, that's my problem with every relationship, every person that I talk to, I get in there, I want to have a good time. How do you feel about you and LC, on paper? I think we would always have a good time. But I think that because we're so similar, You're in the honeymoon phase, right? And you love talking to them, love being around them, but... our job here is not to be in the honeymoon phase, our job here is to find someone that we spend the rest our life with. And that's important, but... Yeah, man. I hope you find some clarity. - Hello? - Hi. Hey, how are you? Good, how are you? Hello? Hi. Hey. I've waited so long to find the perfect person, and I think Barnett is someone I can spend the rest of my life with. I'm ready for him to ask me to marry him. What are you doing? Drinking red wine. Let's do some fun stuff. - I wanna have fun. - Okay, what do you wanna do? Um... Twenty questions? Truth or dare? Truth or dare. Is it true that... you still feel the same way you felt last night about me? I don't know. Wait, really? - Yeah. - Oh. Okay. Ah! Jessica would be a good wife. but after my dates with Amber and LC, I'm scared to have to pick between any of these girls, because I know all the qualities that they have, and all the good things that can come from each person, you know? I don't know what's up in my mind. I know I have connections, emotional connections with people. And I don't know how to, like... differentiate feeling good from, you know... feeling the L-word, almost. Okay. - I feel like I should go. - Why? Because... I don't fuck with people like you. What does that mean? Like, I'm not playing this game with you. I'm not trying play games, I'm trying to feel everything out right now. - I'm trying to be rational. - Well, why... I don't know why you said everything you said to me, then. What are you trying to figure out? My freaking heart, man. Your heart? About what? I just don't know what it's feeling. - I'm trying so hard... - Oh, my gosh. Stop. I don't know what's going on. Now you're trying to figure it out? I know a million guys like you. That's a load of shit. There's people that don't know what they want, and that's you. You don't know what you want. - A million people have told me. - That's what I'm trying to do. Okay, then you can try to do it with somebody else, - because I'm fucking over this. - Okay. You told me last night that you were ready to propose to me. That's insane. You literally said that last night. I like you. I'm not even entertaining this conversation. This is embarrassing. Okay. Bye, Jessica. Fuck. Just say something ♪ Being married is the next step in the rest of my life, and it's... If I don't start now, who's to say that I'm ever going to find someone? Like, any of these girls. I look like a freaking fool. I have all these conversations with someone, and then tell them how I feel. I tell them that, you know... like, they're strong in my mind, and... Fuck. Don't let that dude fuck with you. - What? - Don't let Barnett fuck with you. What do you mean? I'm just telling you, he's a fuckboy. I just walked out on him. - Who'd you walk out on? - How so? What do you mean? He's been telling me a lot of things. He told me he's going to propose to me, last night. He told me he wanted to propose to me, and make me his wife, and he just told me tonight... I was like... That's what set me back, I'm like, ""What the hell?"" He is a total dick. He doesn't know what he wants, period. What just happened is is really kind of earth-shattering for me. Your relationship with him may be different, but I think... I know, but it gets to the point... I know, I know. Do not let him fucking make you look like he just made me look. I told her last night that I was, like... considering proposing to her, almost, and like, I feel fucking ridiculous and stupid as shit for saying that shit. Like, I'm not trying to be an asshole. It's just, I can't help my ability to connect with people, and that there's multiple people that I connect with. I don't know. Again, I still strongly believe that everyone's relationship is different. Maybe he's having issues, but he told me tonight that he doesn't know what he wants, and he's fucked up in his head. That's what he told me. After telling me he was literally... What? After last night, literally telling me he was gonna marry me. Maybe it was less of a serious, ""Will you marry me?"" and more of a off-handed, ""Yeah, I would marry you tomorrow,"" which I guess she took more seriously than he did. So... I don't know. Hello? Hello. I'm pissed, because I had visualized Barnett as someone I could spend the rest of my life with. Yesterday, I was thinking, ""Mark, Mark, Mark,"" and Barnett came and distracted me with this game. So I really hope that I didn't mess it up with Mark. He is just everything, everything I've ever wanted, and so much more. What's up? I'm so sorry. I feel like such an asshole. I just, like... I don't know, I feel like I had to think. I didn't know what was happening. I swear, though, like, it was him, like, I swear to God. It wasn't me. Now I'm just like... I don't know... Babe, I was so confused, you know? And I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's cut off. Like, it is totally cut off. I'm not seeing him anymore. Barnett is definitely not what I want. Baby, I don't want to date anybody else. I know my worth, like a thousand percent. Like, I know who I am. I know what I bring to the table, and I know everything I'm worth. And I'm not second fiddle. Look, I'm real. I'm not some dude, acting like I'm something I'm not. One of the things my mom always taught me growing up, is that when you love something, and you let it go, if it comes back, it was always for you. If it doesn't come back, it was never for you in the first place. And I could feel it. She was like, ""Babe."" She said ""babe"" like a thousand times after that. Jessica's finally telling me what I've always wanted, and I don't know how to how to take it. It's like I just can't wrap my head around it. Now, I always want you to be Yeah. And so, I want you to know that, like... I do care about you. And I get it. There's a lot of societal shit, whatever, and there's a lot of, you know, shit that we would have to combat. - Yeah. - We just don't know what's gonna happen. I've taken a step back a little bit from Mark, and letting him know if there are connections with other people, and I wouldn't blame him for wanting to take a step back from me. Now I don't know if I'm going to end up with anyone. about this experience. The ""physical and emotional gauntlet"" is what I've called it. It's overwhelming, but in all the best ways. I honestly don't believe that if, had I not gone through this process, I would have found the woman of Kelly's caliber, in the real world. I know that I found someone that I can trust, and that's the biggest thing. And she can rely and trust in me forever. - Milady. - HI. How are you today? - I'm great. - You're great? - Yeah. - I can tell. Yeah. I've appreciated this journey with you. I know that I need to be with you, and you're exactly the person that I've been looking for. And I'm going to go ahead... I'm going to cover my eyes, because I kind of want to just black every single thing out... ...and just be with you in this moment. - Okay. - Can you do that, too? - Yep, I will close my eyes. - Okay. I'm going to go ahead and get down on my knee. Mm-hmm. And I'm going to ask you, Kelly Marie, will you marry me? I will, yes. Oh, my God. Are you excited? - Yeah. - I am so pumped. I love you today, and that love will remain, but I can't wait to learn to love you even more. I love you, too. It's so surreal. I don't know how to even describe the thoughts that are going through my mind. I've found someone who... I've worked so hard to think of and dream of in my head. Oh, my gosh. You are just this... perfect person on the other side of this wall, and I cannot wait to meet you and touch you. Oh, my gosh. I have longed for this for so long, and I just feel like he has been my missing link. like having that companion, and it's just, like, complete right now. Um, I can't wait to see you. I can't wait to see you either. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Whoo! - Whoo! - Yes! - Yes! Oh-oh. Let's go! - Yeah! - Whoo! Hello? It feels so good to hear your voice again. - Yeah. - So, something, seemed like in your past, or something has happened that has caused you to feel that you're not beautiful. Why is that such a fear for you? Because I feel like there's so many beautiful things about you. Well... I guess moving here, like, America, I was different, you know, and then I got picked on a lot in high school, and for some reason I just felt inadequate. This is hard... for me. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Hearing you talk is just, like... I got picked on a lot in school, too. I got made fun of. I was tiny and small, you know, I was... quirky and weird, I guess. And it really took years after high school to figure out who I am and what kind of man I wanted to become. You know, everybody's had something in their past, but, like, you've got to love yourself, and you got to trust, and let other people love you for who you are. And if they can't, then, in simple terms, I just say, screw 'em. Mm-hmm. Are you ""uh-huh""-ing, or are you humming? I'm ""uh-huh""-ing. Uh-huh. I have definitely thought about the visual first impression, because I do want him to love me on the outside, too, even though we've connected on such a great scale, emotionally. I definitely want him to... I want him to love this shell, too. without a shadow of a doubt, that I was meant to meet. She and I didn't share any descriptions of each other. I can just tell that she's such a gentle person, and to me that means so much more than just, you know, some other physical characteristic. Hey! How are you feeling? She's beautiful. She's perfect. She's a little, you know, I can just bundle her up, and she just buried herself in my chest, and it's like we've known each other our entire lives. I'm so excited. I'm ready. Yeah? Good. - Yeah. - Good. Kenny and I got to know each other on such an emotional level, because we couldn't see each other. And the physical attraction was there, too. I mean it was in tenfold, because I know what makes him who he is. And he's just so beautiful inside and out. I'm so excited for the next few weeks, and hopefully the rest of our lives together. Hello? Hi. I, like, really miss that voice. It's really crazy. After our talk yesterday, I went to bed thinking about you, and when I woke up, you were the first thing I thought of this morning. It's scary to have this amount of emotions, so fast. And it's not like me. I don't, like... I don't get attached quick. That's the same thing with me, too, but... something that is kind of like in the back of my head... is that I self-sabotage all the time. But I realize that I do it when something that's too good to be true is happening to me. Because my parents' divorce really fucked me up. I guess what I'm trying to say is, this is something that I've always been afraid of. with and without Damian. But my life is so much sweeter with him in it. I don't want to picture my life without him. I mean, I'm scared, but... I know you don't wanna get hurt, as much as I don't wanna get hurt, and I feel really strongly about you and the way things are going, and I think I could really see something with you. Mm-hmm? Am I falling in love? Am I in love? I want the answer to be ""yes."" I feel such a strong connection with her right now, and... it's unbelievable, but there's always that fear of losing her, and it's a scary thing. But I feel right now, we've built such a strong bond, that I'm willing to stay here to find out if she is my true love. Thank you... so much. I'm the one that should be thanking you. Feels like I've been here for months. I'm drained, just emotionally drained right now. Last night was really rough with Jessica, and I'm scared to only have a couple days. I just hope for happiness. That's all I see, is just like whoever I'm with, just smiling all the time, and making them smile, and, like, me smiling too, obviously. Because I just want a good life. - Hey. - Hi! What are you getting into over there? - Oh, I brought my ukulele. - Oh! You play the ukulele? I wanted it to be surprising. Are you about to serenade me? - Did you write me a song? - I wrote you a song, it's called Okay. Every single person here, guy or girl, has gotten to a point where they're like... All of us are like, ""I wanna marry this person."" And we've known them for a week. I've gotten on a level here that I've not even gotten with myself, much less another person. But now I'm already way past anything with Barnett emotionally, and I don't even care what he looks like. I never thought I would say that. - That's the only part I know. - Were you ever in choir? - Was I ever in choir? No. - Really? No, I get my singing practice in the shower. - Oh. - It's like where I... That's where you really turn it up? Where I turn it up. Yeah, like my dog sits outside and looks at me weird. See, I don't live by myself, so for me it's the car. Yeah, I like to make up my own songs - while I'm driving to work. - Me, too. And I sing to them in the car, and I'm like, why does this sound so good? I mean, I should get a record deal, right now. LC, I like you. Yeah, you're the kind of guy I could definitely fall for really quickly and know that I would have a lot of fun with, which is my most important thing, always. That's what I was thinking, you know, we're so alike, it's ridiculous. And we like a lot of the same stuff. What's a song you know on the ukulele? Nothing, I don't know any songs. Okay, well, all right. - Let's just... - You like Taylor Swift? I love Taylor Swift. I don't know any Taylor Swift. I was just asking, because I like Taylor Swift. - You do? - Oh, yeah. Have you been to her concert? If she was in this, she would be the person I'd be marrying. Me, too. So what you're saying is... What I'm saying is... Taylor, if you're watching, and I end up single after this, Okay. I haven't been vulnerable in a long time, and I haven't been open in a long time with anybody. It makes me feel good to know that someone on the other side of that wall cares about me. How real has this shit got? So real, I didn't realize some of the issues that I have were still issues for me. Open up, girl. Fuck, where do I start? My... one and only serious relationship. This is going to be my future husband. Like, I told him, ""I think I might be pregnant,"" and immediately he's in problem-solving mode. ""Well, how are we going to fix this?"" Like... it wasn't... Oh, God. I just... No, I got you. I know where you're at. I know what's going on. I don't have kids right now. So obviously I didn't follow through with the pregnancy. It was the... Oh, fuck. - It was... - Yeah, you're okay. You're okay. It was... It was really the hardest thing I've ever gone through in my life. I was still learning what it meant to be in love with somebody, and because I loved him so much, I... I had an abortion. Uh... Shit. It's not exactly something that's like... I'm proud of. After the fact, we were just talking. I'm telling him, like... I'm trying to explain what I'm going through, like, I'm having a really hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I don't eat. I'm not really sleeping. I just... This was supposed to be my other half. And his reaction, he goes, ""Why don't you just get over it? You just need to get over it already. Like, move on."" That is the last thing in the world you want to hear. I need to know if a situation like that comes up, and an unexpected pregnancy happens, I'm not going to be... I won't be forced to choose. I can't survive that again. Like, I just... I... It would destroy me. Deep breath in. Force the air out. For the first time my life, I know what I want. I want her. It scares the shit out of me. When you're in love, you know, it's scary, right? It's something that's powerful. As guys, we're taught that we are supposed to be in control, and for this, you're not. I am nervous, anxious, because when it comes to Giannina, I'm afraid that she'll get scared, and maybe leave, because she gets scared when things are too good to be true, and when things start to become real to her. She seems to pull away. I am going to propose today. You ready for this? I'm ready. I have fallen in love with who Giannina is as a person, and it is so much more beautiful than just basing somebody off their looks. Giannina, I love you with all my heart. Thank you for coming into my life, and letting me know what it means to live. Hello. Hi. How you feeling? Good. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. I would love to hear your name again. Your full name. My full name... is Giannina... Milady... Gibelli. Giannina... Milady... Gibelli. - Bingo. - Hence, ""GG."" - Hence, ""GG."" - So I want to tell you... I've been... figuring out what makes Giannina tick, and I wanted to give you something that meant something to me. And I start putting things in this box, things from other countries, places I've been, and things I just... That say it's Damian. Did you get the box? - This is my thoughts, my memories. - Okay. And when you open the box, what do you see? Empty. It's empty, because I stopped. I was like, this isn't right. Besides my brother and my family, you've now become the most important thing in my life, and I cannot put you in that box. So I took the bow off the box. And I put the bow on my right hand, because today I don't just give you a piece of me, I give you all of me. I am your gift. Giannina, I love everything about you. Giannina Milady... Gibelli. Before you, I get on one knee for the first time in my life, and I ask you to take this bow. I ask you, will you marry me? Mm. I wanted to tell you something..."
Love Is Blind,01,03,"Will you marry me? I wanted to tell you something. One thing that I don't believe in is... roles. Or labels. I do whatever I want. And what I want you to do is I want you to stand up. I'm standing. So... throughout this whole thing, I have been trying to find my soulmate. I see you as my equal. And I'm just as strong as you. So I want to ask you, Damian Powers, will you marry me? I will marry you. I'll marry you, too! - I accept. Oh, fuck. I love you. I love you, too. I never expected that. You scared the shit out of me. I wanted to surprise you. You surprised me. I cannot wait to hold you. I'm going to break this thing down in like two seconds. So, I'm engaged to a man that I've never seen before and that is so me. That's something that I would do. I can't wait to see you, Damian. You're amazing. And I look forward... to spending the rest of my life with you. Me, too. - I love you. - I love you, too. Today, I feel strongly towards two people, but I, you know... Like, I try to avoid that conflict as well, I guess. I really want to be married, but I'm so scared of making the wrong decision. So... So, um.. my indecisiveness is killing me right now. I know I'm confused in the head. I don't know what's going on right now. You told Jessica, ""I can see you being my wife"" and all this stuff. You said that. But you weren't honest to everyone else on how you felt about that. Not just me. I'm talking about the other two girls. Yeah, you're right. Communicate. It sucks. The conversations fucking blow. It is fucking awful to be... The conversation with Jessica I had yesterday was the toughest I've had, ever in my life. Jessica was conflicted on what was going on. She was going back and forth. And now she's telling me she's committed to me and I don't want to be like Barnett: wishy-washy, uncertain. Because I know what I want. And that's Jessica. Accept the conflict. Accept it's going to happen, - and fucking go for it. - Yeah. To the night when I surrendered ♪ I found my person, which is Jessica, and I've never in my entire life been able to open up the way I have with her and built this connection with her. I can honestly say I found the woman that I want to spend the rest of my life with. All I hope is that there's no doubt in her mind that I'm the man she wants to be with. - Hello? - Hey, babe. Oh, God, hearing your voice... It's literally the best thing... Oh, man. The first time I heard your voice, I just knew. And there's no words that can ever, ever, ever... That I could even describe to the feeling that you give me and I promised each and every day that I will love you... even when times are tough. I promise you to be that rock. I've never been so certain about something in my life, and it's so hard for me to let people in. And for you, I let you in and I love every second of it. Jessica, you have my heart and there's nobody in this world that I would rather spend the rest of my life with. I want you to picture this kid from Chicago, with his heart in his hands, getting down on one knee, and Jessica... I want to ask you... Will you marry me? Hello? Yes. Of course. Of course I will. I want to kiss you, I want to hug you. - Oh, my God. - Oh, God. I love you. I feel like I came into this... Like, I honestly felt like God put me here. I don't know why. I was like, ""This is so weird, what am I doing?"" But I just want like forever with you. I don't want this to ever end. I'm so happy right now. - I love you. - I love you, too. My heart's beating out of my chest. Oh, God. Like, I love you. And I mean that. - I love you. - I love you. I just got engaged. I did. It's been 20 years of pushing off commitment, but it was easy to commit to Mark today. Love is so blind. I'm marrying a 24 year old. Oh, my God. I tried to push him away, because that's what I do, and he wouldn't let me. And now he is my fiancé. I'm so excited. I'm happy. We're good! I'm excited. Let's do it, like... - I'm excited, too! - Whoo! A lot of people try to say you should wait until you're 28, 29, 30. I'm like, but when you find that person, why wait? But next time, babe, Jessica, answer and then cry, 'cause I about had a heart attack at age 24, so... My God, I'm... I wish you could see me right now. I want you to enjoy the rest of this day and we got the rest of our lives. - I love you. - I love you, too. Being in love with Barnett is a roller-coaster... The way he's been interacting with other girls... seems so indecisive. I'm not the only one in this, so I don't know, you know, what's in Barnett's mind. And if it's just feels like such... high stakes right now. Even though I feel like I know who he's wanting to be with, and it's me, I don't know that for sure. I don't even put myself around Amber at this point. I just think it's an exhausting thing to be around. Honestly, I don't see Barnett with anyone else. If he does end up with her, then I was clearly way off. Like, way off, about the kind of person he is and wants in a wife. I mean I'm probably, like, one of the luckiest guys in the world right now. Like, I have two freaking amazing people that are so interested in me. But how can two people be so sure and I'm over here, like... I have no freaking clue. I have a huge fear of having this initial spark with someone and it just fizzling out. And the intensity of Amber... like, I'm scared that it's not going to last. LC... I know she'll love me and I know... it may not be as intense as Amber, but it could be for a long time and it won't burn out. Honestly, I thought about not proposing to either one. I don't want to hurt someone and I know it's going to happen. And I'm feeling the fucking pain right now. It's the... For sure, the toughest decision I've ever had to make. So... I know I've put you through... probably one of the hardest experiences of your life. This has, uh... been... It's been the toughest... thing I've ever had to do. I've thought... everyday and I've... I've tried to think, you know, what my future holds and, you know, what's the right decision for me. You know, I have to follow my heart. It's, it's... It's not you, LC. - I literally can't even cry anymore. - I know. Like, you just don't have any regard for what you're doing to people. Otherwise, you wouldn't have done this to me. I would have never... never... let you get to this point if it were me instead of you in that position. This is my real life and my real feelings, and... I know. You're not really the person I thought you were, honestly. Have a great life. I'm walking out the door. Why the fuck do guys not ever feel that sure about me? Ever? It's not just here. Like, I feel like they're always, like, scared and run. Like, I don't know what I'm doing to do that. Or am I just like... Like, an unlovable person, which I don't think that I am. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Clearly, I don't... I'm not seeing it. I don't know what's going on. Like, I'm just like... having, like... Marriage is a big deal to me because it's a lifelong commitment. I've never wanted to get married unless I felt like it was right. If I'm going to spend the rest of my life with this person, I want to make sure... that it's going to be someone that I'm going to... be happy with forever. Okay. Amber, um... you... are the only one... that... makes me feel this burning... fire in my heart. But... Oh, shit. Amber... Will you marry me? Oh... Oh, my God. Yes. - Was that ""yes""? - Yes! - Yes? - Yes! Fuck, okay. Whoo! Yes. Yes. Oh, fuck. For the first time ♪ I am not... ever going to make you doubt that I... love you, and I'm going to love you forever. was stronger with Amber. Amber... look at me. Look at me. Oh, I'm going to make you the most stressed-out girl in the world. But you're gonna make me the happiest man in the world. I'm already freaking off the walls right now. I'm so happy already, so... God. I love you. Oh, shit. Whoo! - I already told you I love you, right? - Yeah. - I do love you. - Yeah. Ah! Yeah. Phew. I have insecurities when it comes to... how I look. What will she think of me? She's such a... spiritual and loving, kind soul, that I don't think she's looking for somebody... for looks. She has touched me without touching me. And... for the first time in my life, I think somebody's finally... seen me without seeing me. I want to just stare at him. I just want to process him, see if he matched what I thought in my head. I have no idea what I'm going to do when I see Damian. I don't know if I'm going to laugh, or if I'm going to cry, or if I'm gonna pass out, or if I'm gonna throw up, I have no idea. Oh, God. Hurry up. Finally. Oh, my God, I love you. Finally. Oh my God, you're so strong. Hi. Hi. Hey. Hey. Mm. She is stunning. I mean, she took my breath away. Her smile was so bright, her skin tone's so soft and so fucking... It's beautiful. It's so different and I love different because... different is beautiful. Who knew I could get so deep? Ah! This girl brings out a lot of stuff in me. You have really pretty eyes. - Beautiful eyes. - You have such pretty eyes. Today I give you me. I give you all of me. Wow. - So, tonight you have a piece of me. - Good. Damian. - Dame. - Dame. Dame. G. It's interesting. Because I pictured you, obviously. I never pictured this. I love how Damian looks. I love it. I can stare at him forever. But my old habits would have been like ""Wait. Now I'm doubting myself."" 'Cause I self-sabotage. And I didn't do that with Damian. I am... so happy. I can finally let that wall down. Giannina... She is fucking beautiful. I'm sorry for the F-bomb, excuse me, but she is gorgeous. I hope she's going back thinking, ""He is a handsome man."" It's crazy that in just four weeks, Giannina... is going to be my wife. I am... I'm a... I'm a lucky man. I see you. Mm. Barnett has chosen me to be his wife and he has gotten a whole crazy handful. He just... refused to let me love him! And he finally gave in. Today, I get to meet my fiancée. Oh, it's giving me butterflies. Roller coaster. Let's hit that drop, come on. I'm nervous as hell. What if she doesn't like me? I don't know. I haven't, throughout this entire process, been able to picture his face. I haven't been able to fabricate anything that I feel like is close enough to who he is. I'm really hoping for a nice smile and pretty eyes, 'cause I'm a sucker for both, but c'est la vie. Oh, God. Okay. Oh, gosh. - Oh, shit. - Hi. Holy fuck. - Hello. - Hi! Oh, God. Hello. Oh, my gosh. Oh, God. Oh, God. - Wow. - Hi. - Holy shit. Hello. - Hi. Hi. Mm. - Hi. - Hey. How's it going? Wow. Did you know the whole time he looked like that? Like that's... That's my fiancé. All right, I'm going to need this hand real quick. I refuse to let you change your mind again. I'm gonna stick that on there right now. Barnett... frustrates me and he irks my nerves and he drives me to the ends of insanity, and... I fucking love him. I adore him for it. Like, I love that he challenges me and makes me laugh. And I love the way he makes me feel and... y'all, I love the way he feels. Oof. I'm just... I couldn't be happier right now. - Oh, my God. - Don't you dare snort on me. I got something for you, too. I had actually picked something out, so... Is that for me? - Yes. - Is that mine? Hopefully it fits. Oh, Jesus. Hell, yeah, this is the fucking right decision. Yeah. Damn, I'm lucky. Shit. I wasn't nervous at all, but damn. I was a little nervous. Oh, God. Oh, my God. - I just want to... - I'm okay. Snuggle me real quick. Don't ever let go. I'm not going to let you. They're not going to take you away from me. I'm engaged, y'all! Oh, my God. I'm engaged. Oh, my God. You're so irritating. I know I am. I know I am. I'll always be that way. Barnett has put me through the wringer. And I have no doubt he will probably do it again. Open the door. But I am still, and always have been, up for the challenge and it feels really good to know that he is, too. - Hi. - Hey. I never thought I would come out of this engaged and definitely never thought I would come out of this engaged to that... freaking smokin' hot piece of... sexiness. Holy shit. Finally. Finally. It's literally the most freaking beautiful girl I've seen in my entire life. Mm. I'm going to miss you. Yeah, you are. Yeah, I am. Yeah, I am. I'm so glad I didn't let my stupid brain fuck this up. See you soon. Ah! Oh, God. Whoo! Me and my fiancé get to go on a vacation and I am ecstatic to get to see what... this connection is going to be like in the physical world. I'm gonna just need to forewarn you guys, you are not allowed in our hotel room. Y'all got to stay out. This experiment for me has changed my life and I'm 34 years old. I... thought maybe this was something that would never happen to me. It happened. It happened! Ah. I'm engaged to someone I never would have expected that to happen. I didn't think about the possibility of someone... so much younger really becoming my everything. But, yeah, I'm 100% head-over-heels in love. Jessica, I love you, baby. I'm going to make you the happiest woman in the world, no matter what conflict is in front of us. No matter what adversity, obstacle... You're my person. Thank you for choosing me. I couldn't be more thankful to be with you. I found the one, and it does not matter to me at all what he looks like. If he's a troll, I literally don't care. I found full-blown love like I've never experienced before and it didn't come from seeing someone across the room who I thought was hot. It came from... really connecting with someone on a deeper level than I've ever experienced before. Fuck. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Oh, shit. Fuck. That laugh. Fuck. I wanted to do this in person. Jessica... Oh... Will you marry me? Yes. Fuck. Wow. Did you see her? Seriously, like... holy shit! Whoo! What? That's my wife! That's my wife. Seeing you right now is... the best feeling, I... Is this the image you had in your head? I don't even know what image I had in my head. - Hopefully... - What was it? - I don't... I couldn't tell you. - This is better. Yeah? I asked someone earlier what a 24-year-old looks like. I didn't know, but you look like normal. - You look like a grown-ass man. - Yeah? Is it the beard? - It's the beard. We'll keep that. - Okay, phew. I won't shave it down, I promise. I wasn't sure with someone that's much younger than me. Would it be awkward? And there was zero awkwardness. It was just like finally being able to see this person you've created the deepest emotional bond of your life with. Um, I was instantly... very, very attracted to him. I'm looking forward to getting married and creating a family that we can grow forever. But I know when we walk out of here, we're going to be met with a lot of adversity. I know friends and family will have their opinions. Hey, babe. - Whoo! - The person I love may not be the stereotypical person that people would choose for me, but he's my person and I know his soul. He is the most special person I've ever met and age is not a factor for us. We're not worried about anything that stands in our way. Oh, my God. Holy shit. In this blind love experiment, six couples have fallen in love and gotten engaged, sight unseen. Hi! How are you doing? Oh, my God. Their weddings are just four weeks away. Now, they've seen each other for the very first time and they've come to this tropical paradise to help turn their emotional connection into a physical one. Up until now, the only thing that's mattered is who they are on the inside. Now, their love will be put to the test. Will their relationships flourish or fail once they're exposed to the physical realities of the material world. What the couples don't know, is that they're all gonna be coming to the same resort... right here. They started with love, an emotional connection. But... is love enough? - Thank you. - Gimme your purse. Hold this. It's cool because we're kind of working like Benjamin Button. You know, we're working backwards. I know what he values and I've told him my deepest fears, everything, but I still have yet to explore him. So, I'm excited about our first night together. I fell in love with my fiancée without ever seeing her and it's, it's, it's... weird. It's different trying to establish the emotional and physical connection together. When you have a really strong emotional connection and then you're bringing the physical into it, how do you get them to become one? - Hmm? No? - No. - No? - I don't know. Mm. - Mm-hmm. - See? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Yay. Gracias. - Oh. - Oh. - Oh, yeah? - I was gonna dive in. Ha ha! Cheers. Cheers. The Grand Velas Maya Rivera. Stunning. Mm. It's a dream. And I am here. Obviously. But I can't believe that I'm here. I just don't want it to ever end. It doesn't have to. - No? - It doesn't have to. Okay. What do you think of all this? I feel like it's a... fairy tale. Something tells me you've always wanted a fairy tale. Yeah. Well, it's just because I always grew up watching movies and reading books and they always described things like this and it's always what I wanted and the fact that I'm... here... Unreal, is what it is. Definitely. I can not be happier to be here with anyone else. You have touched me in more ways than you can understand. And... I love you. I really do. I love you more. Oh, you're gonna make me... - Pull yourself together! - I'm working on it. You get me all emotional. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. That truffle sauce... - Is that what that is? - You know what truffle is? I've heard of chocolate truffles. You're sexy. So it's looking pretty romantic in there. I'm just telling you, it's been 435 days. It's just been 435 days. - Are you talking about... - Yeah! So you're talking about 435 days without sex. - Yeah. - And you've counted. Day 325, I went to the beach so I can remember how it feels to have my ass smacked, right? - By the waves? - Yeah, by the waves. Exactly. 'Cause it's been a while. As I told you before, like... I will move at your pace. The sex is not... important. But I do enjoy spending time with you and getting to know you more. I want it to be right. I don't want it to be forced just because we are engaged. I just want to tear his clothes off. I don't know. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Um... But I'm just not hungry anymore. - You're not hungry. - Nope. - I'm not. - What about dessert? I am dessert. Oh. This is good. This is good. I hope this isn't hers. - Happy to be here with you. - Mm-hmm. - Me too. Same. - And you're pretty, too. - You're pretty. - You're pretty. Thank you. - Yeah. - Thanks. I am so excited for my first night with my fiancé. Just to like, see him and touch him and smell him and just cuddle with him. I do want to have sex with my fiancé, but, like, not today. I think we should take things slow. I love talking to Kenny. So I feel like we'll, like, stay up and just talk to one another and probably just share some kisses and hold each other, 'cause that's something we obviously didn't get to do, up until recently. Lounge on the... the sofa? - Whoo! - Yeah? Yeah! Our emotional connection is great. Our physical attraction is super strong. So, yeah. I feel the sex will be, actually, really good. He's a really good kisser. So, I think he has some talent... elsewhere. It's so good to see your face. Like, to literally put like all the sounds with the expressions now. - Yeah. - I can put my arm around you. - I can put my arm around you. - Yeah. - We can count shoulders. - Nice. You ever counted shoulders? - Counted shoulders? - Yeah, you do one, two, three... four. I knew that I was going to accept whatever she looked like for exactly who she is. And who I knew her to be in the pods. Uh, but, yeah, I'm very much physically attracted to Kelly. She's the most wonderful person that I've ever been around. Her, you know, personality's infectious, her laugh's infectious. Uh, everything about her. Even holding her hand. Can I jump on the bed? So you're already jumping on. Shoes on and everything, huh? Expectations for Kelly and I's first night together is probably a lot of kissing, probably a lot of cuddling. She's so pretty. Mm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. You're a pretty, girl. Mm-hmm. I'm not asking for kisses. I know, but you want them. But I'm a-lookin' for them. Oh. Mm. Being engaged is awesome, aside from the whole being terrified part. But I'm definitely hoping that the physical part with Cameron matches up with our emotional connection. This is so sexy this whole... - Everything. - ...shebang Mm. - Rose petals... - Mm-hmm. Hot tub. You. Me, you. I can't think of anything else that we need. This is it. I would love for this to work out for Cameron and I because he's everything I've ever wanted in a husband and a father... to my future children. I've never felt like this with any man and I think that we would have a wonderful life together. What more do we need? I know. - It's hard not to be a creep. - I know. - It's really hard. - It's hard, I'm trying. - 'Cause now, it's like, finally... - Right. I mean, it's just, you know... It's just two people in love. That's what happens. Yeah. Yeah, of course I'm excited to be spending the night with Lauren. You know, we've been talking through walls, and... we really haven't had that, that time to, you know, be alone with each other. We're definitely sizing each other up. Yeah, I like what I see, to put it very lightly. This vacation's going to be one to remember. - Can I use your toothpaste? - No. Of course! What's mine is yours. Now we share. You know, your chest hair is not that bad. - No? - I thought it was going to be worse. You thought it was gonna be worse? What were you expecting? I just thought I was going to be like... super, like... I don't know, like... bush. I've never dated anyone that was white. This is going to be, like, a new experience for me. And my thoughts are that he looks good. Cameron is very sexy. He's very attractive. He has a little swag, so... I definitely want to jump his bones. Why is my mind in the gutter? It's been way too long, y'all. Good lord! I'm sorry, Mom and Dad. I'm sorry. I'm an adult. I'm an adult. Whee! Mm. And good night. This is so beautiful. Whoo! Oh, shoot. Here you go. Yay. I am super excited to be with my fiancé on this romantic getaway, And I'm so excited to make a beautiful life together. Mm. Could you imagine being the strawberry dipper? The things you say. I just tend to say what comes to mind first. That's beautiful. I like that about you. Hello, Mexican police? - Come get this lady. - Come get you! - She's crazy. - Bye-bye. They wouldn't touch me. I had to pick the craziest person in the house. You thought I was... I'm not crazy. Yeah, you're crazy. I knew that from day one. - Why? Because I spoke my mind? - Mm-hmm. - That's normal, ain't it? - Mm-mm. You better be happy you pretty. - I get away with stuff because I'm pretty? - Mm-hmm. Okay. I would have been punched it a long time ago. - ""Punched it""? - Punched it. Like, ""leave."" Okay. Hmm. Watch your words here. Come on. Chill out. Carlton is definitely a different energy than what we had in the pod. I don't know if he's nervous or if he's uncomfortable with something. You make daddy feel good. That's why you have that hat on. You're not slick. Ooh! You're not slick. You want one that says ""Mommy""? When I am a mother, I would love to have one. I'm gonna get you one that says, ""Do not fucking touch."" No, I would not wear that. Well... What about one that says, ""Carlton's wife""? Okay, I'll do that. - You would? - I would do that one, If I'm your wife. ""If""? I'm saying, we still gotta walk down that aisle. Oh, we're walking down that aisle. - Okay. - Ain't no turning back - Ooh. - What you gotta figure out? We gotta move in together. What do you mean? I have a big secret to tell Diamond about my sexuality and I'm so nervous. Every moment that I spend with her, it's in the back of my head. If I don't roll it out the right way, it could just turn into a catastrophe where she just can't deal with it. I'm gonna get you a pogo stick so you can hop out of your feelings right now. You know what? You trying to start something. Whatever. All right, so I'm just gonna go to the pool. No, there is no pool. I think this conversation's gonna get... It's over. Before it gets too deep. This is our first night together. I'm excited. What number is it? And I'm the happiest girl in the world. This is us right here. Ah! - Yay. - You ready? This is the first night outside of the pod and it's freaking me out that I'm engaged right now. Did I really just do this? My parents don't know what's going on right now. I don't have my phone so no one knows where I am. No one knows I'm in Mexico. It's... It's crazy and it's tripping me out. I love hearing the waves crashing on the beach. That's my favorite thing in the whole world. - I'm thankful. - Me too. I love you. I've always been a very sexual and romantic and passionate person, but I have always been missing that emotional connection. I believe that now that I've finally developed that emotional connection before that, I think that Jessica and I can really turn it into... It's going to feel as though I'm a virgin. Experiencing something for the first time with brand new eyes in a first experience and I'm excited for it. Ah! This shirt. - Love it, love it, love it. - I'm gonna go shirtless. - You're going shirtless? - Yep, going shirtless. The person I fell in love with was a voice. And now here he is in the flesh. This is him, and I'm struggling a little bit, so far, in just... meshing the two people. We're about to get extra friendly here. All right. I would say he's not the typical... guy that I would go for. My normal type is... usually a bigger guy. Um... Just a bigger guy. So... in this experience, like, I really feel like people can kinda jump in very quickly, get into a sexual relationship and then things don't go well... and it can be very, very painful. So my preference is that we don't go there. My whole thing is I would never force you to do anything you don't want to do. It's me and you. We started this whole thing just, again, talking. I want to get to know you more. I want you to be you. I don't want this to be something that it's not. The whole reason we're here is because we took a leap of faith. - And because of that leap of faith... - Agreed. I think, you know... Whatever I think we both agree on, yeah, we make it work. I'm not ready to just, you know... jump on him or anything like that, but I'm kind of excited because I think part of this whole experiment is we've got an emotional bond, it's not someone I would typically go for based on looks, so let's see if we can build off that and see if that attraction can really grow and that we can be as deeply seeded together physically as we are emotionally. Hey. Oh. I don't know. You might have drank all my champagne. It's okay. Just bring the bottle. Perfect. Yes. This is our first night alone together and there is a little bit of awkwardness because you know this person but physically, their body, their appearance... Seeing them is totally new to you. But, that connection, that fire is just as strong- as it ever was through a wall. My fiancé is fine. Oh! I'm gonna have such pretty babies, y'all. You're just going to drink out of the bottle? It's what I do. Like a champ. - That's my fiancé. - Yep. I definitely feel like Amber's the right girl for me. And I feel like our physical relationship is increasing... our emotional connection. So, if things happen, they happen, and I'm not expecting anything, but we'll see. - Pretty ring, who got it for you? - I don't know, some guy. Some weirdo proposed to me through a wall. I guess I said yes. Man, I'm wearing an engagement ring, too, - and it's a man version. - Oh! If it gets warm, I'm sorry. Don't you dare! You're nasty! I know you. I can tell when something's upsetting you and I'm like, is everything okay? It's just that feeling, that energy, I have with you. I've never seen this side of Carlton and it really hurts me. I'm so confused, I don't understand, it's just so many feelings are running through me that I don't even know where to start. You okay? - What's on your mind? - A lot. With you, I feel like... I can be myself completely and I feel like you know when something is off. Like, you can sense it. Like, I really love you, but it's like certain things are, like, always in the back of my head. Certain things like what? Like the past. I feel like there was no possible way you could... Like, a woman like you... as perfect as you are, as beautiful as you are... Aww... Hey. What's wrong? It's just stuff that we have to just discuss because... I feel like... I've always been in situations where people have abandoned me and have, like, rejected me. First off, you don't have nothing to worry about. - Yeah, I do. - No, you don't. I do. I have a lot to worry about. - You have no idea. You have no idea. - In regards of me. You could leave me at any moment, because... I haven't fully opened up. What... What is it that you want to open up to me about? I don't feel like you're going to want me after this information. What information? In the past... I have dated both genders. What do you mean? Like male and female? Male and female, yeah. It's a lot to accept. I get it. It's okay. Like, I have my fears. I have... I have gone through the thought of... Fuck, you met the love of your fucking life and now... My question is, how do you know I'm the love of your life? Do you ever feel like you need to go date... - No. No. - ...another man? No. That is the biggest misconception in the world. The biggest misconception in the world for men like me, who are honest, I love... people for who they are... at the core. This has nothing to do with it. This has nothing to do with it. Like, that has never been the motivating force in my life. It's a lot to accept. Yeah. Like, I'm looking at you right now and... - I'm listening. - I feel like your eyes are so blank. - It's a lot to take in. - I know. I know. Fuck! I cannot feel you ♪ We were literally four weeks away from our wedding. Like, I love Carlton, but I was not prepared for that. I... may leave this earth alone, but I will leave this earth saying I was fucking honest. I didn't fucking deceive nobody and I did one of the hardest fucking things that was ever done. I'm not a hider. What am I hiding for? Why can I not be myself? You can be yourself. You can be yourself. I just... I just need time... to think about this. It's... I mean, you just threw a curveball. I know. I'm going to... - Go, just go. - See you later."
Love Is Blind,01,06,"Damian Powers, will you marry me? I will marry you. Will you marry me? I will marry you. I will be your wife. who I've never seen! You're such a beautiful person. I don't have to see you to say that. Ho ho! Yeah. How you doing? I've never had a man so willing to show me how much he loves me. You know when people, like, name stars? - I want that. - Well, we will find a star, and we will name it after you. Gentlemen, meet the ladies that you did not propose to. Seeing Barnett and Mark, who would you say that you're more attracted to? You know, I would take Barnett. I know I don't want to go meet your family with a ring on my finger. There's nothing I don't like about you. Nothing. I'm lost in your eyes ♪ I like it. - A catamaran. - I like it. Come on back. All right. So how's everybody feeling about, sort of, like, you know, vacation wrapping up and, like, us heading back into, - you know, move-in day? - So ready. Ready to be back. And I've loved this entire experience, it's just... seeing the rest of everything, the reality. The reality of everything come together, and... I'm so torn because, like, I want to stay in the bubble, and I like the ""just us"" thing. But also I'm super excited to get to, like, introduce him - to everybody back home and share. - Yeah. I do think some of the couples... They're more in their heads instead of their hearts. They're not really embracing what they're feeling, because it scares them. So I don't really know if everybody is honestly going to... make it to that ""I do,"" but I know Barnett and I will. Oh, wow, I just had mad déjà vu. - Wow. - That's deep. Okay. Oh, my God, we were meant to be here, you guys. I've been dreaming about y'all. It is weird how familiar everyone seems. It's crazy. It's amazing how Cameron's still so calm through this whole process. Cameron's just like, ""this is amazing."" That's just... That's just me, y'all. - This breeze is amazing right now. - It is! This is what we were waiting for. The calm before the storm. You know what? Storm's a-brewin', guys. Storm's a-brewin'. Welcome, everyone. Good morning. Hope you've enjoyed your romantic getaway. Lauren and Cameron, Gigi and Damian, Kenny and Kelly, Amber, Barnett, Mark, Jessica... In this blind love experiment, you guys chose each other. You fell in love, and then you got engaged to the person who is now your fiancé, before ever seeing one another. You've had an amazing opportunity here to begin to grow your emotional connection into a physical one. Yo. I'm guessing some of you had more fun with that than others. Not naming names. No names. I don't know what y'all are talking about. Now it's time for you to leave this paradise and start building your lives together. Each of you will move into a new home: A neutral space for you guys to deepen your relationships. But it's so important that you continue to support each other when you go back home. No one else on the planet understands what you ten are going through. And now you guys will have a support system that's very, very close. - Like, next door. - How close? How close are we talking? We all dated, guys. Let's not go there. Each couple is going to be moving into the same complex. Meet your new neighbors. How thick are the walls? Oh, my God. Lauren, is that a good ""Oh, my God?"" I don't know yet. - Bunch of misfits. - I know. In this physical world, your love is going to be put to the test. You're going to face so many challenges. How are you guys going to integrate your lives? Your friends, your families, your careers, your homes. You'll get your phones and devices back. Ooh! Your weddings are just three weeks away. Ooh! - Okay. - Yeah. In the pods, you guys all built an amazing foundation. And if you make it through these tests, I promise your marriage is going to move forward on extremely solid ground, a ground that you've built. It's as strong as, or stronger than, any marriage ever. We're giving you the absolute best chance for lifetime success. But will you allow the opinion of family and friends, the allure of other people, the distractions of social media, to sabotage your wedding? Sabotage your happiness? This is all part of the experiment. Will you judge one another for your looks, your race, your age, your family, or your circumstance? Will any of that really matter? Or will love be enough? Is who you are on the inside enough? Are you enough? Ultimately, in front of your family and your friends, you're going to decide. Will you say ""I do"" to the person you chose sight unseen? Or are you going to walk away from them forever? Is love blind? We hope that you prove it is. Everybody, have a safe trip home. Best of luck with your wedding plans. - Yes, we'll see you guys back home. - See you soon. - Take care. - Safe travels. Good luck planning the weddings. See you guys. Safe trip. - Yes! - Cheers! No, but it's been fun. I mean, getting to know you and see you every day and hold you, and... Not that I won't be able to do that, but, you know... It's just different when there's no other distractions. Social media and phones and all that stuff you know, it's just different, so... Going back into the real world, we're going to have distractions. I think one of the biggest challenges is social media. There's images of girls, images of guys. We've talked about this. You know, you have full access to... you know, see who's texting or direct messaging me. I mean, it's not... - I don't have anything to hide. - Right. Um, I think I left something downstairs. I bet you did. Am I nervous about the outside world? I'm not nervous, I'm curious. 'Cause things are gonna change. But how? We'll see. You think they'd be mad if we just, like, sort of stowed away in here? This isn't a boat. I don't think that's how this works. We're sad to be leaving, but we are excited to start our lives together. Let's get outta here. - Step by step. - Yep. Day by day. Let's do it. - We just got home. - Mm-hmm. And guess who is heading on a trip. This one. It's all right. I have to go to San Diego for two days. Which means that I'm not gonna see him after seeing him now. - Be safe, I love you - Aw. I'll call you later. - Yes. Hey! - Say hi! - Hi, this is Mark. There's something about just landing at home and getting back to normal life. I got my phone back, and the first person I call is my mom. I've never gone that long without checking in with my mom ever before. So, it was just a sigh of relief that I let her know what's going on. I've come back with a fiancé. She's told me that she can make Italian beef for me, - so I was like, all right, that's it. That's it. Welcome home, guys. Aww. Thanks, guys. Ready to see our new home? - Yes, let's do it. - Let's do it. This is our first night together, in our new place together. - This is nice. - Yeah. I love it. Oh, man. Bedroom. Cool. Cute. Cute. The wedding is in three weeks, and on the inside I'm freaking the fuck out, okay? ""A,"" because I think that planning our wedding is going to be stressful. ""B,"" I'm anxious just kind of about sharing space in general, because I have been alone for a long time. That sounds bad, but it's the truth. It's my truth, I own it. - I'm ready to eat. - Me, too. I just have to keep reminding myself, like... ""You love Cameron, this is going to be great, it's going to be beautiful."" And so I just think that the next couple weeks are going to be hella stressful. You know... What's up? I feel like I'm crunching so loud, like... And it's funny, because one of my pet peeves is when I can hear people chew. Yeah? What are your other pet peeves? I'm a clean person, so I don't like clutter. And I feel like if you use a dish, like, just wash it. Um, what else? Oh, put the toilet seat down, please. Because if I fall in the toilet... ...I will not speak to you. Even though I love you, don't use my toothbrush. Some people do that. Do you do that? I wouldn't have a problem with it, but I'm not gonna do it. Oh, my God, honey. What? That would really bother you? - You using my toothbrush? - Yeah. - Are you for real? - I mean, just... Have you shared a toothbrush with someone before? Have I done it before? Yes, I've done it before. Oh, my God. As a married woman, I am willing to share a lot of things with my husband. We can share food, we can share a bed, we can share a pillow. But I'll be damned if we are sharing a toothbrush, Cameron. That is nasty. That is nasty. Nasty! No. It's just, I can't. I can't do that. I just can't believe he even said that. Unbelievable. No way. Mm-mm. But I love you. But not that much. No, I'm kidding. - Wow. - I'm joking, I'm joking. What's some of your pet peeves? Not being able to use your toothbrush. Oh, my God. - This is pork. - I cannot wait to tell my mom that we're engaged. She's going to freak out. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. Like, everything's going to go into hyperdrive because the wedding is in three weeks. - Geez Louise. - Three weeks. - Three weeks. - Are you gonna... Are you scared yet? - It'll hit me. - So... In case you try to run, you should know that I put a tracker in your ring. - I mostly promise. - I'm... I'm nervous. Oh, God, I'm so ready to eat. Are you excited to tell your mom? Mm-hmm. I'm nervous to tell my family. Why? They're gonna think I'm insane. I think my mom's gonna be excited because she thinks I'm going to settle down. Joke's on her. - You're as weird as I am. - Mm-hmm. I think it would be hard for somebody that hasn't lived through this to understand how serious it is, and how legitimate these feelings are. If you've never lived it, you'll never understand it. You complete me. I don't typically unpack the day of. Today you do. Considered you're an organized mess, I'm going to make you organized. Without the mess. There's a lot in there. I have a feeling, like, there's more coming. Well, moving in with Damian is going to be another adventure. We're going to be here forever. I brought a lot of unnecessary things, maybe. But you always have to be prepared. So, I dress in my mood, That's how you know. That's why you have so many different outfits. - Yes. - Oh. God, Giannina. Look at that, see? That didn't take too long. Three more suitcases to go. What's going on? - Hey! It feels a little weird to be here without Kelly in the apartment. You, uh, you make it on time? the conference. for a second, Oh, heck, yeah. Heck, yeah. Being alone tonight for the first time in five days, it'll be a little strange. You know, I'll miss Kelly. Knowing that she was, you know, there next to me definitely brought a sense of comfort. I'm sure that it's going to be tough for her to fall asleep in San Diego on this, you know, work trip. All right, babe. Well, I will let you scoot, and I'm going to get back to eating some dinner. - Okay. - All right, babe. I love you. - I love you too. - Cheers. - Cheers. - To a new home. - To a new home. Now that we're back in Atlanta, I'm just looking forward to having somebody at the end of the day. When I get back from a trip, being able to come home to him and laugh. You know, as you can see, we have a lot of fun. So that's something that I've been missing for a long time. I'm hoping that that can really reignite my passion and hopefully set off this other physical piece of our relationship that I have been trying to, you know, fill. We have a very small bed here. Much smaller than anything I'm used to, and I don't feel uncomfortable, kind of crawling in here with him, so I think that's a step in the right direction. - So I noticed you got your ring back on. - I did. I signed up for this experiment. I want to be in it fully. So I put back on the ring and I'm here, and I want to be present in this. I'm opening my heart up to this whole experience, so... It feels awesome to see kind of like a switch turn for the better, and I'm excited to see where the rest of this journey goes. I think what's really important is getting back to what got us here at this point, is being able to communicate. And it's one of those serious things that is... If I'm going to the bathroom on a double flusher... No, she didn't. What? Seriously. That takes a long time. Well, you know what? By all means. I proposed to someone I didn't see. By all means, we're on this level. - We never talked about poop. - Never talked about poop. - That would've been the deal sealer. - Would it have been? You should have started with day one. You don't want someone who's constipated. If you would've said... No, if you would have said... - They'll be pissed off. - ...""I'm a double flusher kind of girl,"" then I would have been like, ""You know what? I got you."" Mark, everyone poops. Okay, so this is the serious question I have, though. - Because if you want to get real close... - Yeah? ...are you comfortable being in there while Mount Vesuvius is erupting? I will hold my breath. But as long as I can brush my teeth, and... - That's love! - As long as I can go like this - and brush my teeth... - That's love. Looks like we're officially all moved in, honey. - I know. - It's like the... honeymoon is over. But the honeymoon phase is still going on. - It still feels pretty good to me. - I still feel like I'm floating. Now that we're going back into the real world, I'm sure that we'll have a lot of hurdles and obstacles to overcome. Parents and friends and their opinions. I mean, even the fact that we are an interracial couple. But I love Cameron for who he is on the inside. You know, that's what I fell in love with. And if we get married, I think that we would have a wonderful life together. Whoop! You're so romantic. I love it. Mm. I don't know why I'm, like, nervous for you to see my place now. You are... I am who I am. So today we're going back to our own respective homes... - This is my block. - Okay. Here we go. My place. ...to pack up what we need to live together up until the wedding. Here we go. This is the dollhouse. - Beautiful. - It's small, but you know. - It's okay. - Yeah. Good things come in small packages, they say. Right, right? So this is mi casa. - Let me give you a little Cribs tour. - Please. Uh, this is my studio. My place is definitely my sanctuary. Even though it's small, I've really made it my own. I'm a bit of a loner, so I guess I'm just protective over it in a lot of ways, and I was just hoping that I didn't leave anything out that I forgot to put up. I like to make vision boards. - Oh, this is kind of like Mexico. - Right. - Oh, wow. - It's kind of crazy how similar that is. - Yeah, that's awesome. - We had rose petals in our little pool. Wow, we did. Aww, this, too. - I'm seeing the beach and... kayak. - Yeah, Mexico. Where? Oh, yeah. I was a little nervous about Cameron seeing my messy ""throw everything in there"" closet. Um... Grab those. But he didn't judge me, so it's okay. Let me get my camera stuff. Do you want this as well? - No, I don't need that. - Okay. Thank you, though. Mark loves me unconditionally, but I don't want to be naïve to the fact that some people are not going to be happy if we get married. I don't want us to be super disappointed when the real world smacks us in the face and doesn't accept us. Oh, my God! Brown on brown on brown on brown? I've never seen this many shades of brown, actually. I swear to God. I don't ever use these shades of brown. It's kind of funny. How now brown cow? God! Is this a beanbag chair? I haven't had one of these in a while. Don't do it. Why? It's cozy. Look at all your gaming systems. My little brother would dig this setup. - Do you need your college history book? - No, it's my personal training book. Okay. Sorry. Let's sit down so he can fill us in on what's happening. He lives with his best friend and his best friend's girlfriend. So... God bless him. I could never have roommates again. I have thought a ton about what our friends and what our family will say about our age difference, and I keep reminding him that that is going to affect our relationship. He's really strong-willed about the fact that we can get through anything, and I want to believe in that, but I'm also realistic. How's it's been without me? Uh, well, we have food in the pantry and in the fridge. - We bought groceries once a week. - Yeah, uh... - Well... I told her, I was like, literally our house is based on sarcasm. It's like the second you walk in and you mess up even a little bit... - Even a stutter... - We're all over you. - We're all over it. - You gotta be on your best game every single time you're in this house. I mean, you come here, you come prepared. Alright, alright. I like it. The cool thing about Mark, something I've always admired about him... is he gives 110% to whatever he sees and he puts his mind on. Anything he does, he does real well. But the problem is, the things he doesn't want to do, Jesus couldn't convince him to do it. He is not gonna do it. - Like what? - Like the dishes. - He does not like to do dishes. - What? - That's not true. That is not true. - Oh, really? That is not true. I picked up your dishes this morning. - Night one in the apartment. - What? Any dish that will fit in a dishwasher, he'll load it in there. But if it's too big, forget about him hand-washing it. - All right, I'm making notes over here. - Yeah. And I'm drinking. Well, Mom folded some laundry for you. It's in your room. She did your laundry while you were gone. - That's amazing. - My heart. I hope you're also taking notes of this. Laundry. You know... I work 70 hours a week. We've had this discussion. - I don't do laundry. - Mark, you're gonna do the laundry. No, I will never do his laundry. I will never do his laundry. I don't even do my own laundry. I'm happy to I take his laundry to wash-and-fold. So we aired all his dirty laundry. Tell us about yourself. I work for a technology company and I travel quite a bit, that's one thing we've talked about. Our jobs are totally different, our lives are totally different. I've got a golden retriever and a house in Peachtree Hills. So, yeah. That's awesome. So I'm curious. I gotta know. What did Mark tell you to pick him? Um... I've always been kind of scared of commitment because I felt like it was never the right person. You know, but with him, just something clicked. And it was because we created an emotional relationship. In three weeks we're getting married. - That's fast. - You know... - Yeah. - Yeah. And for right now, I can see... I felt like these guys didn't judge us at all. They didn't ask anything about the age. So I really liked that. And, you know, Mark's told me to trust him about that this entire time, and now I feel very at ease about the situation. But I'm... - You put me in an awkward predicament. - You've got big competition around here. - Wow. - He did pretty good. - I picked a pretty good one, so... - Nice. Picked a pretty good one. But yeah, no, it's... I don't know. Excited about it. That's awesome. I've put my ring back on because I want to be all in. It was nice meeting you, Jessica. Good luck to you guys. Right now I feel really great wearing it and seeing if this thing will work out for us. This was a huge day for us. - Love y'all. - See you later. - Bye. - All right. It's quite large, sir. It's very nice, though. Very Southern. When I bought this three bedroom home, I had my hopes on the idea that I would have a wife, and I could start a family with her. So... Now having Lauren in my life, you know, I might try and plant some seeds in her mind while she's there. Oh, wow. This is really nice, Cameron. - Yes. I love the wood floors. And the fireplace. Right. - Oh, wow. Everything's like new, too. - Yeah. Well, you show... I don't just want to walk around. - You show me. - Oh, no, please. I mean... - This is your place. - Well, it could be our place pretty soon. - Could be. - Yes. - This is nice, I want to explore. - Okay. - The master. - Here we go. It's freaking big, Cameron, for just you. - Hopefully not for too long. - You must have anticipated, um... - Mm-hmm? - ...having someone else very soon. - It took a while - It's beautiful. Ooh! Wow. This reminds me of, like, the frat houses in college. - Yeah. - Yeah. A lot of them had, like, the balconies like this. Right. This home is beautiful. You have plenty of space for me in here. It's so crazy, like, just... Like, seeing this and thinking about the future, and, like, ""Oh, this could be a kid's room."" You know, I'm so happy to hear Lauren say that she could think of the empty room in my house as a kid's room. I was originally thinking it could be an office space for her, and it still could be, but... Crazy as it sounds, I'm, I'm... I'm ready to have children with her in not that much time. I mean, we want to enjoy being husband and wife... but, you know, I want her to have my babies, so... Yeah. I want it to be your home. Yeah? You want me to live here with you? I do. You know, I have found the one. I was in love once before. And I loved that person very much, but... I knew that there were going to be problems, always. Things that I couldn't get past. But with Lauren... I don't have those concerns. I would love to. I do love my place. I think that the location is excellent of my place. Mm-hmm. How would you feel if I kept it? Um, well... I don't know. - Okay. - Yeah. I mean, does that bother you? Like... Why are you laughing? - Nothing. You seem uncomfortable. - Really? I'm not trying to rush you. - Yeah. - But, you know... Okay. I am feeling a lot of different emotions. Thinking of, like... Wow, I could really just be giving up my personal space forever. And I really enjoy my personal space. But being in a marriage kind of changes everything. So I'm just trying to listen to myself and my heart, and my mind, at the same time. This is all feeling quite real. - It's feeling quite real right now. - It's very real. We're not in the pods anymore. I know. This is your real life. Yeah. It's overwhelming. But I don't think I can finish this ♪ No ♪ Here is my home. Aw, baby, it's so little. - No! - Just kidding. - I kinda want that... - It's cute. It's huge! My house has one bedroom. It feels like if I have kids, like, we're always going to be on top of each other. - I like it. What? - It's alright. - What do you mean? - It gets the job done. My house is a mess. I mean, my carpets are dirty because I got a dog, and she pees a little, sometimes, inside. I don't want her to think less of me because of my house. I think, just the way it looks, the size of it. Hi! Hi, pretty girl. Hi, baby. Oh, God, she's huge. Hi, Coda. - Did you miss me? - Come on. Hi. Oh! You actually have furniture. I do have furniture. You... It's not as bad as I thought it was gonna be. - It's nice, baby. I like it. - I got papers here and there. These are my stairs. That hole in the wall is from Coda. - Oh, boy. - Never fixed. How did she put a hole in the wall? She's very clumsy. I pick my girls clumsy, too. - Oh, that's fair. - She runs too fast. - This... This is the bed. - Ooh! The bedroom. Really? You couldn't even make your bed? Come on. This is me and Coda's bed. It's me and Coda's bed. I didn't know when I'd be back. - Ooh! - Ooh! - I fits. - It's a big tub. If I fits, I sits. I like this. - I don't know if I'd sit down in there. - What did you do to the bathtub? - Nothing! - Oh my God. What? Oh, hold on. Closet. - Closets? - Can you get the... Okay, all right. You got all this space and you can't even keep your clothes hung up? Coda, what have you been doing with this fool? You haven't trained him yet? I'm sorry, okay? So I am a little less responsible than Barnett in terms of my assets. I never really worked towards the future. I never thought about having a home. I was more of a ""work just enough, so that I could enjoy my life."" You're gonna get all the dog hair on your ass. Since the place that I'm living in now isn't really even mine, and I'm not going to be living there much longer anyways, I'm just really excited to move into B's house with him and start making our home there. I would love to be a stay-at-home mom, and right here and now, as far as I'm concerned, it's our house, and our family that may or may not be started there. It's our relationship that's gonna grow in that home. That's all I care about. My house is very small. If we do move out of here, we'll be getting another loan for another house. I have an average credit score. It's not great, but it's not bad. But also because I've only got one credit card. It's my makeup credit card, but it's only a $700 limit. Still seems pretty high for makeup. I'm at the limit. You think that. Okay, makeup is expensive! Wait, you have makeup credit card debt? I do, I do. It's really easy to run that up really quickly, okay? And I think the last time that I actually used it, I spent like, over $200 in one spree. - On makeup? - It's expensive! So, uh, you know... Oh, and then there's my student debt from where I never graduated college. How much are we talking about? Well, around about 20 grand... that I have not been paying on. - You haven't been paying? - I have not. - No. - Oh. I have been pushing it off, and off... So it just gets worse, and worse, and worse. - Do you pay the minimum at least, or no? - No. I haven't paid anything. I've been out of work, or I was homeless for a while and I was, like, couch-surfing between, you know, my friends' homes. How many days a week do you typically work? As many as I want. I work to live. I don't live to work. I think she knows you're stressed. Are you sure you want to marry me? Wow. Alright. - I love the style. - Thanks. Who is it? Hi! Hi, pumpkin! - And, wow. - This is my house. If there's anything I ever pictured of, like, you, it's like this. This is my room. - Wow. - Relax. Seriously, you're way more color-coordinated than I am. I feel like I've come a really long way in my career and I'm really secure in where I'm at. But being on the road can be really lonely and coming home is usually the worst part. Um, because you realize there's no one to come home to. So it's awesome having him here, and opening up my reality to him. I'm someone who wants kids, and I'm no stranger to science. So, like, I realize that if I want three kids I probably have to start soon. - Mm-hmm. - At some point. Dude, if I'm 24, I don't want to be having kids in, like, a year. You know? Like, that's like very young. - So, I'm gonna be like... - My parents were, like, 20. My parents... Like, my dad was your age. My mom was, like, 19. So here's my thing. Again, I'm not your average 24-year-old that is like... I've done, like, whatever. I've partied, I've hung out, I've lived my life, had experiences. - Yeah. - Cool. I'm ready for the next phase of my life. Like, that doesn't stress me out, the thought of having kids. Guys my age aren't ready for kids. You know, that's something that will drive guys 35-plus away. And I think that's one of the biggest, you know, reservations for me is I look at Mark who's like, ""Oh, yeah, I'm ready for kids! Yes, of course I am!"" And it's like, ""Really?"" I don't want him to settle down with me and then regret it. Okay, so let's play this out. - We have a kid, and I'm like, 36. - You look good. You're 26. Cool. - The kid turns 14. - Mm-hmm. - I'm 50. - Okay. - You're 40. - Okay. How do you feel about that? - Just... It doesn't bother me at all. - No? Mm-mm. - At all. And I know that sounds... - Okay, let's play it out further. - Okay. - The kid turns 24. I'm 60. Mm-hmm. - He's 24, I'm 60. - And I'm 50. At that point it's... What, we're both... - Yeah. - Okay. We're both in our 50s and 60s. It doesn't scare me. Like, look me in the eyes. I can look you in the eyes... - Yeah. - ...and say it doesn't scare me. Biologically, yes, I understand the... Okay, as a woman you... We have to do this soon. She keeps throwing scenarios at me, saying, ""When I'm 50 and you're 60,"" and I'm like, ""And?"" Like it doesn't matter about the age. It's gonna be us. Okay, so, then in 10 years, if the kid's, like, eight years old... Mm-hmm. ...and I want to move to California or I want to move back to Chicago, and that's when your parents would be and you told me you want to take care of them. Mm-hmm. So, how does that then come into play? I'm not shouldering that burden by myself. Me and my sister are both responsible. And my parents aren't people that are going to be the type of people that be burdens. You know what I'm saying? Like, I want to put... You do not know what's going to happen to your parents. - And that's what... I'm being very careful. - And I don't want to say anything at all. All I know for right now is that my decision, what I feel here, is that whenever I have to make a decision... Say we move to California with our kids, - I'm going to make that with you. - Yeah. Not with the influence of, like, what my mom thinks. Because my mom will always support what I do. Mark is very emotionally available. To me, it's a bit of a red flag, because no guy is that emotionally available. I've never seen it. Never experienced it. It's like we're watching an experiment on Discovery Channel, for all I know. I mean, he's... Everything I say, he's up for it. Thinking about, like, if we're to take the next step in three weeks and kind of, like, playing that all out, you know, I think, like, the leading... reason for divorce is, like, finances. I've never thought about anybody, really, other than myself, because I've never been married or had a kid or anything like that, but things happen very quickly and you want to make sure that you're able to provide that security and comfort. For a long time in my professional life I wasn't making six figures, you know? And then, like, it feels like, once it happens, it just kind of, like, continues to grow from there. In this moment right now, I'm not the financial provider. I know that. I'm going to be honest, I'm not going to lie to you. - Yeah. That's okay. - And, you know, that's just being real. You know, I'm not making, like, $100,000, you know? But I know now, with what I know with fitness and where I want to go with it, I just want you to know that, like, I may not be, like, there yet, but I'm, I'm... I hope you see my mindset of where I'm gonna be. This isn't gonna be butterflies and rainbows all the time, and that's why you see me tonight... I challenged him and challenged him. Because, you know, I want this to be successful at the end of the day, and I don't want us, you know, in three weeks to walk down the aisle, and this all be for nothing. Um... But what are your thoughts around, like, kind of like gender roles and how they play into managing finances? Again, I refer back to my mom, and how she is, you know what I'm saying? And I see a lot of qualities similar. And so my mom has always been that, like, rock. She's always been my rock solid, like... That's my woman. And that's why I'm attracted to you. Yeah, you're amazing, and not just what you... The physical features. It's you as a person. I want to be me, though. I don't want to be your mom. And I get that, like, you want to channel your parents, but you have to be you at the end of the day. You're a grown-ass man, you know? I wouldn't... I don't want you to be... Trust me, like, I'm good. Like, same thing, mentally. I'm good. Like, you know what I mean? I'm not saying it's, like, I want you to be a parent, you know what I mean? - I'm not telling you... - I don't want to be your parent. Or in comparison to my mom... I know you don't, and I'm just setting the ground straight now. You compare so much to your mom, I want to make sure you're keeping things in perspective. Yeah, yeah! I'm not trying to recreate your parents' marriage - or something like that. - I would never want that. Or recreate your mom. I'll never live up to your mom. I'll never be your mom. Like, you've explained her to me a million times, - I am never going to be your mom. - I'm just proud of her, basically. - No, and I love that. - And I say that... That's where my head was at, and it's, like... - I don't want somebody... - Girls get intimidated by that. No one lives up to Mom. Ever. No one can live up to Mom. - Trust me... - And I'm not trying to. And I would never want you to. There's no competition. There's no competition, because my heart is open to you. I don't want you to think you need to compete with my mom. He won't stop talking about his mom. And I'm like... dude. There is no comparison between you and my mom. My mom is separate, and she is... My mom will love whoever loves me, and I will love whoever I love because I love them. I don't seek the approval of my mom. I understand. Your mom's an incredible woman. I can't imagine how incredible she is. But every single topic, we relate back to Mom. Going into a marriage, if I'm really being realistic, like, I would definitely want to put like a prenup in place. Like, off the bat. I genuinely love this person. And so that's what's confusing me. It's not like we didn't talk about this in the pods. You knew how old I was. You knew! And you ignored it. You said, ""Whatever, I want you."" You knew what I did for a living. You said, ""Okay."" You knew everything about me in those pods. You said ""yes"" to me twice. Once behind a wall, and once in person. You could have easily... When you saw me in person, you said ""You know what? No. I'm good."" But you said yes. Um... Because we've kind of been sequestered because of this whole experiment, we haven't really told his family yet. None of his friends know yet. So, for Barnett's birthday I am trying to get all of our fellow experimentees together and just kind of have like a little birthday celebration for him. - What's up? - What's up? Happy birthday! - Blow them out, babe. - Blow it out! They weren't trick candles. I was really expecting trick candles. - Happy birthday, baby. - Happy birthday, Barnett. Thank you. - What's up, buddy? How you doing? - Oh, I'm doing all right. You surprised? - A little bit. - A little bit? Just a little bit? Don't get too excited, it's all downhill from here. Bam bam. Birthday shots. Are we doing shots? - To Barnett. - To Barnett. To Barnett! - Happy birthday, Barnett. - Happy birthday, Barnett. Baby! Yes! I had these expectations, like, it's going to be a happy-go-lucky life. I thought when I found her, that was my pot of gold. No, no, no. That was the start of it. That was the beginning of it. I found the rainbow. Now it's time to go on that journey and find what it is. It kind of sucks for me because, like, he's such a girls' guy. - Who? Uh, Cameron? - Mark. Oh, Mark. - Being in love is terrifying. - Preach. And the more in love I keep falling with Barnett, the more scared I am that some... screw is going to be thrown into, all of these, these working gears, and something is going to mess up. And it's... - You can't do that though. - I know, it's... You can't, dude. I try not to think about it on a daily basis, because I'm so excited for how things are working. - Then be excited. - I can't lose a love like this again, for any reason. I think it would destroy me. I know it's so easy to say, because even in my situation, I'm like, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. Because I don't want to lose a love like this. I look at her every morning, and I'm like, ""Fuck... What did I do to deserve that?"" I'm just someone that usually likes the unassuming, laid-back guy that's not like, talking about emotions with girls. And Mark is very, like, out there. Don't put so much pressure on making it work, and just enjoy. Live, breathe, because you finally deserve something. So do you have feelings for someone else? - No. - No? Mm-mm, mm-mm. Nope. So it's not, like, somebody else is in the background. - No, no, no. - Okay. If it... If you... - Oh! - Oh! Sorry y'all. When I get married, I do want to make sure that it's the right person. I guess I looked back, and I actually looked at a journal entry. I was so excited about Barnett. I did connect with him on such a deep level, and I was very passionate about that connection. And I thought, ""Oh, this must be it."" - Happy birthday. - Thanks. I'm really glad that I got this. It's the only thing I cared about. Dude, What is it? IPA? No, that's perfect. - That's so good. - ""Ippa."" I love ippas. So good. - We're like right next door to it, too. - We're right next door? What's you're... It's across the street. - What's your apartment? - What? - What's your apartment? - We're... We're two floors up. So I don't know if you're ever on the balcony, but I can look down and spit on you. I keep being naked in front of the window, and I'm like, ""Oh, I forget I live in an apartment now."" - Yeah, that's my problem, too. - My... My bad. Sorry, guys. Always naked. So what's up? How's, uh... How are things? Things are okay. Things are okay. I'm not... I'm not there. You know what I mean? Like, me and Mark are so dissimilar that it's... - Really? - It's like... Yeah. I mean, we're 10 years apart. We're like... Different decades. Different decades. Like, you name it, like, we're different. And... all those things. Why did you say yes, then? Shit. I think I was so... I was coming down off of us. Caught up in the experience, yeah. There were 48 hours in the day. I thought about you for, like, Like, it was insane. Yeah? Yeah. I was like... I, like, was so high on that, and then, like... Then you said, ""No, I didn't feel the same way,"" and I... I was coming off of that. Like, I was like, ""This is what I've always gone after, and it's not worked."" And here I am, and this person's liked me since day one. And then I was like, ""Oh, this person's loved me since the beginning."" Like, it's so, like, my whole life playing out and, like, maybe I should just go with that, like... I don't know. Um... Sounds like it's meant to be. I know. Oh! Oh! Oh, God. It's over there. I threw it... I threw it closer, a little bit. So how are you feeling about Amber? Is she everything you expected? Uh, she's... Actually, it's more than I expected, so... Which is good. She definitely gets me out of my comfort zone, like... You never struck me as a person that would go for Amber. And it's weird to see it all come together. - I'm like, holy shit. - You told me that a couple times. We both have pasts. Do you feel you guys are emotionally connected? I know y'all are obviously, like, physically, and, like... What I don't want is, like, for you to feel some sort of, like, physical, sexual thing that, like... And then you're married, and, like, two weeks down the road you're like, ""Fuck, I don't have things in common withthis person on an intellectual level."" I want to make sure that y'all are there. I know it may seem like we're always, on top of each other and stuff, but we're not. Aww, shenanigans. Where's... They're over there talking. I do just want to revisit for like a minute, like, the fact that, like, you were so confused two weeks ago. I want to make sure that... you're doing what's right for you, you know? I found someone who's gonna love me a hundred percent, no matter what. I think so, too. Her whole life is you. That's it. - Her whole life is you. - I know. You deserve it. You do. Hey. Nothing will ever break the bond we made. I know, I know. - Literally. - We had a friendship. We do. And honestly, like, I... want the best for you. So, like, if anything ever comes up, you fucking... You reach out to me. Yeah. Jessica probably had a little too much fun. I never felt like there was anything I had to worry about with my fiancé, but if I felt like she stepped over the line one more time, I would break her face. I adore you. Aw. Bless her heart. Uh... Mm. I love you the most. Love you, too. What's going on? Nothing, baby. - I know. I'm just happy, I'm good. - Have a drink. Hey, you know... - What happened? - Nothing. Ah. So good. I don't know where Jessica's head's at right now. Easy deasies. The situation is very hot and cold. I don't know what I'm going to get on a day-to-day basis. Oh, it's so close. Hey, how'd that rim job go? How'd that rim job go? And when she's all over me, and hugging me and kissing me, it confuses the fuck out of me. What? Does it feel pretty natural, living together now? Do you feel like it's pretty comfortable? Why do you keep looking at me? Go ahead. Uh, I mean, yeah, it's... We've had some difficulties just, like... adjusting. More so me, because I'm used to being alone. - I can see that. - Yeah. - Lauren's like a roadblock. She's like... - Fuck you, Damien. ""I can see that, you being a lonely, bitter hag."" No, no, I just like... What is wrong with you, Damian? What? I just try to put a smile on people's faces, and sometimes saying awkward, unconventional things... - Yeah? - It brings out the best in people. It does. And I'm not afraid to do that. - That's great. - Yeah. Is that sarcastic? You mean that? No. I totally mean that. Stop putting her on the spot. I know, like... Very awkward. I picked up that the conversation was awkward. That caused me to feel uncomfortable towards my fiancé. I'm like... I don't know how I feel. I'm confused by the whole conversation. Gigi and Damien are like It's hard to crack. I'm not lying when I say that I'm still trying to read you. The problem is you're reading into things too much. I am, but I don't have... I feel like I don't have a choice, and it's really bothering me. When I feel things were being awkward... Like, I didn't like that. Then talk to me. Don't make a scene by walking off. Giannina is the love of my life. We've built such a strong connection, and I'm scared of losing that. Scared of losing her. So I didn't stomp off because I had a little bitch fit. I stomped off because I'm not processing things correctly, so I left. You said I made things awkward, but they're, like, ""What just happened with her?"" You want to know the reason why I walked away? It was because I don't care what goes on in there and you feel like things are awkward and that's fine. I didn't feel comfortable, right? So what I said was, ""That's not what she felt."" How do you know what she felt? You're not Lauren. Listen to me. Stop interrupting me, please, for the love of God. Stop speaking for everyone else and speak for G. - I'm trying. - You're not. You're speaking for everyone else. - You're not listening to me. - You're speaking for everyone else. You're not listening. You're not even letting me talk. You're bringing me down. You're bringing me down! You're not letting me speak, you're not listening to me. - I have been listening. Listen. For two seconds. I have listened to you since the day we walked into the pods together. - Not in person. - I process. I have. This is what we were wondering was missing. Social situations. Because I don't like to be in awkward situations, which you willingly do. The difference is, G, is when things are too good... No, when things are comfortable, you self-sabotage as you always say. And you will bring... You don't care what you destruct In the process. You don't care if you bring me down. If I didn't care about bringing you down, I would have been, ""That was awkward."" - We've talked about this. - Why wouldn't I have done that? Motherfucker, listen to me. My fucking heart feels like it's breaking right now. Sit here. - Hey, I love you. - Love you. What happened earlier? I was just with Gigi all night and it was crazy, so I had to talk to her tonight, I had to. - I know. - She's the greatest. She's a close second. I'm talking about you being the greatest. That was kind of a compliment. I'm not saying, like... You don't say somebody's a close second. No, that's not what I meant. This is a girl I look at, like, literally as my little sister. Baby, baby, baby. - You're a close second. - Babe. - How is that? You're a close second. - You're taking that the wrong way. Babe, babe, babe. Seriously, I'm not... I did not mean it like that. Stop. I was... Listen, straight up. All I was talking about was you. I was... I'm sorry that it was a bad joke. I apologize for that. - It's the worst. - Okay. Honestly, literally, she's older than you - and she's beautiful and amazing. - Okay. And you're beautiful and amazing. And, literally, you're like, ""Oh, she's a close second."" - No. - Get the fuck out of here. That's not what I was trying to say like that. I think Barnett is fuckin' sexy and, like, hot, and, like... What the fuck is that? You're insulting me like that. Don't insult me like that. Are you fucking kidding me? - Baby, baby. - I'm good. It's confusing as hell. It's confusing. I don't know what she wants. She puts her ring on, she shows it off, and then she puts it away. It's just like this huge back and forth, just like... What do you want? If I get to the wedding day and... Jessica says no, I'm more alone than I've ever been. I never thought it would happen like this. Babe. Come here. But I think it’s just my own ♪"
Love Is Blind,01,10,"I'm Vanessa Lachey. I'm obviously Nick Lachey, her husband. Welcome to the blind love experiment. - Hello, hello. - Hello. Here, you will choose someone to marry without ever seeing them. Amber, will you marry me? - Yes. - Whoo! Once you're engaged, you'll finally get to see your fiancé for the very first time. Oh, my God. And you're going to attempt to grow your emotional connection into a physical one. Motherfucker. Listen for two seconds. I have been listening. Dude, if I'm 24, I don't want to be having kids. Again, I'm not your average 24-year-old. You're like the first white guy I've dated. And in just four weeks, you'll be at your wedding. Will you say ""I do"" to the person you chose, sight unseen? Of course I do. Or are you going to walk away from them forever? Damian Powers, do you take Giannina Milady Gibelli to be your lawful wedded wife, to live together in the holy estate of matrimony? Will you love her, comfort her, honor and keep her, so long as you both shall live? I do not. Okay. - Giannina... - Okay. - Okay. - I do love you. Okay. - Since day one, I... - Mm-hmm. I've wanted this. I've wanted to marry you. I have... I've stayed consistent - all the way through this. - Okay. And... - Okay. - You have not. - I can't handle the ups and downs... - I understand. of you loving me one day, and saying you want to be friends the next. I did not. It would be selfish of me to marry you today, knowing as much as you tell me you're ready, I see that you're not. Just get me out of here. Giannina... How dare you? Get out of my face. G... Giannina. Please, please, leave me alone. Leave me the fuck alone. I'm out of here. Get me out of here. I'm done. Giannina! - Everything is shit. - Uh-huh. Ideally, you would have said no and he would have said yes. Not the reverse, because this way it hurts more. I know. This shouldn't happen. Who does that? You should have said no, no? You should have said no, too. Don't cry. I'm okay. I'm okay. You almost fainted there. I almost died. Buddy. Stand up. You all right, man? What happened, buddy? - She ran. - She ran? - That is the hardest thing I've ever done. - I know. I could tell. I wanted to say yes. I wanted to. Even though she was all-in today, it was... It was one... It's one day she's been all-in, through everything we've been through. And I respect it, I love that. Like, it made me... I wasn't sure if she was going to say yes. And when she did, it melted my heart and broke it at the same time because... in that moment, I was like, ""This isn't right,"" because she's saying yes, but everything she showed me, her actions, her words, everything otherwise said that she is not ready for marriage I feel like I just broke her heart. It sucks. But I need somebody that's all-in... every day. Not just some. - I need to talk to him. Yes. My heart... is literally in a million pieces. I was hurt. Hurt. I want to punch him in the face. But right now, I'm going to figure out why this happened to me. I'm so sorry. You couldn't have told me? Like, for real? I didn't know. You didn't know? - You didn't know? - I almost said ""I do."" Okay. What the fuck happened? What happened? Please, sit down. Let's talk. Apparently, that's the one thing that we can't do. So right now, we are going to talk. Please sit. In that moment, it was... beautiful. Everything you said was perfect. Everything felt so right. But that's one moment for the rest of my life. For the rest of our lives. That's such a beautiful excuse, darling. Because what you said up there was bullshit. - How dare you? - I'm sorry you took it like that. I... Um, you're sorry I took it like that. Listen, Damian, seriously. I didn't want to get my heart broken, so I pushed you away. Great. You kept coming back to me. Why did you keep coming back even though I was putting you down What's wrong with you? So why is it that all of this is blamed on me? This is the problem. You're making it about you. It's both of us that went through this. You literally blamed it all on me. I always treated you with kindness, even when I was in adversity, even when I was uncertain and I didn't know what I wanted. This is what you do. - What? - This is what you do. - What? - You don't realize what you say and how you say it. - And you know what? - Get out of my face, please. I'm not in your face, G. But what I'm telling you is - you did that to me and you said yes. - You blamed everything on me, and all I did was tell you how I felt, and I wanted to work everything out with you. - G... - I wanted to work it out so bad. - This is you running... - So bad! ...and I'm trying to talk to you right now. What I am asking you is not to run. I love you. I'm in love with you, and I always will be. And I know what happened today was embarrassing and you'll never forgive me for it. And I'm sorry. You messed up. Honestly... that was such bullshit. You can take your bow back. I told the woman I loved ""I do not"" at the altar. And I broke both of our hearts in that moment. But if you ask me, ""Is love blind,"" the answer is simple. Love is blind. No matter where we end up or where we go, this was mine and Giannina's love story. This is how it goes. I can't say it's over. We may need time apart. But it doesn't mean we won't be part of each other's lives again. I would like to think so, anyways. The morning of my wedding is a disaster. My fiancé is having cold feet. I got a text from Barnett. He's... He's freaking out. Which obviously doesn't put me at ease. And I asked, ""What's on your mind? What's wrong? Are you getting cold feet?"" And he said, ""Yeah."" So I tried to call him. And he didn't answer. So I tried to call him again, he didn't answer. It's not exactly, uh... reassuring. I don't know what else I can do. Today is my wedding day, and I'm... I'm kind of having a little bit of a... a freak-out. I woke up this morning with this giant pit in my stomach, basically, and it was like... my whole life before this point flashed before my eyes. I took a shower and I started tearing up in the shower just because it was so much. But I built that emotional connection with Amber. I did fall in love with her in the pods, but if I'm going to spend the rest of my life with this person, I want to make sure that it's going to be someone that I am going to be happy with forever. - You have makeup credit card debt? - I do. Oh, and there's my student debt from where I never graduated college. I don't want you to be jumping into something because of... how you guys met. Are you willing to give up everything for this person? Everything? So, what if there is an issue between me and somebody in your family? Can you manage that? Can you stand up to them? Whose side are you going to be on? I don't know. It's the biggest decision of my life. I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet. But it's so freaking difficult. Oh God-dang it. Aww. But every single time I do ♪ Oh, my gosh. Wow. Are you excited, you nervous? What? All of the above. Barnett's freaking out about the wedding, and instead of talking to me he clams up, and that's hard. And normally it's something that I can... I know that I have to deal with, because that's who he is. He's not... - An open person. - He's not a huge talker about it. He doesn't talk about his feelings a lot. And that's something that, even when we started dating in the pods, that was something I was, working on really hard. So what made him be the one, Amber? I felt like the very first time we ever talked, I felt like he could be my best friend. Magical things happen on wedding days, you know. I need all the magic today. - I love you. - I know. I love Barnett an indescribable amount, and I'm just ready. I just want to be living day-to-day life. Like, I'm ready to have my best friend that I can share my life with. I knew from the get-go, from our very first meeting. Do you want kids, Barnett? - Do I have kids? - Wait, do you have kids? - That's a question, too. - Not that I know of. No, I'm kidding. My favorite was Barnett. He made me laugh so much. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, God. Oh, my God. - Wow. - Hi. - Holy shit. Hello. - Hi. Hi. We're just a little bit different. Different enough that it works. You complete me. With everything that we have... been through already, I guess I'd say my biggest fear about this is that I get down the aisle and... Matt still isn't sure. All right. Oh, my gosh. - Ready? - Uh, no. Getting there? Yeah, me neither. I love you. - Stop crying. - You're my baby, Amber. Mom. I'm sorry. I love you so much. Don't cry. Mm. Well, let's get you married, my girl. Oof. They should be here. We've been sitting here for an hour and a half. Oh, Lord. - Ready? - Yes. Oh, gosh. This is a commitment. This is the big moment of your life. - I love you. - Love you, Mom. Ladies and gentlemen, the groom and his beautiful mother. - Slow down. - Slow down. Geez. I'm not crying. It's hot in here. Oh, gosh. My little girl, all grown up. Now remember, no matter what, something worth having is something worth fighting for. - I know. - And you never give up. I've been fighting for this since day one. The moment has arrived. Would you please stand in honor of the bride? Okay? I guess. You're not supposed to have to fight for it all the time. I told you that, too. Make up your mind, woman. It is supposed to be there naturally, Amber Lynn. - It was there naturally. - Okay. Would you make up your mind what you want me to do? You said if it's worth having, fight for it. You said you shouldn't have to fight for it. I did both. I found both. It was there naturally, and I did have to fight for it. Well, I wish you luck. Thank you. Please be seated. Who presents this bride to be wed? - I do. - Thank you. Amber and Matthew, you chose to get engaged and spend the rest of your life together based on an incredible emotional connection. You fell in love with who each of you are on the inside, and you decided to get married before ever seeing one another. Amber, if you will please share your thoughts. Never... have I ever in my life met a man that irks my nerves like you do. I found my love of a lifetime. That's all I got. You're going to mess up my makeup. I never thought that this would ever happen. I never came into this thinking that I would find anyone like you. You are amazing, you're beautiful, inside and out. So... Amber and Matthew, you stand together in the presence of God to decide whether or not to face life together as husband and wife, or walk away from each other forever. Now is the time to decide if love is blind. Amber, do you take Matthew to be your lawfully wedded husband, to live together in the holy estate of matrimony? Will you love him, comfort him, honor and keep him, as long as you both shall live? The fact that, even when you're making me crazy, I still am so in love with you I can't help myself. I do. I will. Absolutely. All right. Yes. You have become so much more than I expected. And I'm excited that you get to keep becoming more with me. Matthew, do you take Amber to be your lawfully wedded wife, to live together in the holy estate of matrimony? Will you love her, comfort her, honor and keep her, as long as you both shall live? Oh, I do. A hundred percent. I can't... I can't imagine a life without you. Good, because you are stuck. I now pronounce you married! - Mm. - Mm. Uh-uh. Whoo! - I love you. - I love you. Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen, the bride and groom! - Love you. - Love you. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, guess what. - What? - You're my husband. - I think you have my last name now, so... - I, um... We're going to make that happen. Amber Barnett. Doesn't sound as good now. - You know... - I'm kidding! Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. I could never have imagined that this experiment was gonna end this way for me. It's unreal that Kelly is going to be my wife. Honestly, I had given up hope and given up thinking about, like, the idea of even being married, just because I couldn't find that right person. I know that I need to be with you, and you're exactly the person that I've been looking for. And I want to ask you, Kelly Marie... will you marry me? I will. Yes. I love you today, and that love will remain, but I can't wait to learn to love you even more. I love you too. - How you doing? - Hi. Oh, my God! I'm a big, big believer in serendipity, and this is one of those serendipitous moments, and everything is just so clear. That's where I feel right now. Just happiness. - Heyo. - Yo. - What's up, man? - What's going on? - Bossman. - Good to see you. I love the 'stache. Thank you, thank you. - What's up? - Good. I fell in love with Kelly, sight unseen because we were both honest with each other. I learned who she is, truly. This is a big moment, wedding day. A little... A little surreal. That's an understatement of a lifetime. Yeah. She's genuine, she's ambitious, she's passionate, and she's the woman that I want to spend the rest of my life with. Fellas, you guys want to check out the suits you'll be wearing? - Let's do it. - That I picked out for you guys? Oh, this is so pretty. We tend to fantasize our fairy-tale weddings and our fairy-tale Prince Charming, you know. - Hi. - Hi. - Yay! - Yay! - Oh, hi, honey. - Oh, hi. - You know... - I love you. I love Kenny. He's absolutely perfect. - Hi, honey. - Hi. But I am nervous because I don't know if I am, like, 100% in love with him. Did you learn a lot about yourself? I did, yeah. What did you learn? I mean, I knew that I... was capable of loving someone for their personality, of course. Um... Would you have talked to him if you saw him before? No, I probably wouldn't have. The love that I had for my ex-boyfriend... I mean, my mom has said this for years. She was like, ""You were infatuated with him."" I don't have that same crazy infatuation for Kenny, as I did with this man. We were able to make this commitment to each other, and then we haven't, you know, had sex yet. I know how I feel about it. Like, how do you feel about it? We are just so perfect on every level. - Right. - And I just, like, don't want to throw that in the mix just yet. That's why I keep saying I'm not in love with him, because if I was in love, I would have that infatuation, like... nothing else matters. But obviously I'm conflicted. Maybe what my whole definition of what ""in love"" is supposed to feel like is not right. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. You're welcome. I know there's, like, so much makeup on my face, but... - You won't be able to tell. - Yeah. So, how are you feeling about the wedding? I mean, I'm... you know, having the decision of, if I say ""I do,"" and if I don't. Um... and, like, what life would look like in both of those extremes. Um, so, me saying ""I do,"" I know that everything would be great, because our, our relationship is so solid. If I say ""I don't,"" it's simply because we're not... It's not the right time. So I've, like, weighed both scenarios out. What are some of your cons? If I were to say ""I do,"" and something were to happen, like, that's what the only, like, fear that I have is that... it doesn't work out. So you still have a little hesitancy going into it? Yeah, and it's like another thing I think of is this engagement has been so short-lived, it's like... But are we still in the, like... Are we just in a honeymoon phase? I do believe that we are both completely true to ourselves, and we're being very real. But even when you're real, you have a honeymoon phase. - Right. - And is it just happy and rainbows and butterflies right now because we haven't known each other that long, and we haven't had a relationship in a long time. - Right. - And it's just a beautiful thing that we've connected with someone, but in four months from now, are we still gonna be in that same... So it's the fear of the possibilities - of it changing. - Yeah. I just have to believe myself and listen to my heart. I feel excited for her and Kenny and everything going on, and I feel nervous for just how she feels. I do think she wants Kenny, but sometimes in life you get an opportunity and if you don't jump on it, sometimes you miss the boat. You know, I met Kenny briefly. He was, like, very intelligent. Confident, too. - Funny... - Mm-hmm. and well-spoken, and he seems very trustworthy. He's been one of the better, if not the best, so far, of the men that you've brought in. So, you know, just maybe when you're walking down the aisle, when you're looking at him, I'm sure, eye to eye... - Yeah. - ...that you recognize what the beauty of the relationship is with him and then kind of go through all of that, even in your mind because I know you don't know, and I don't know exactly what your decision is gonna be - on the altar. - Right. Because things can change from now to then. I want to see her smiling and happy every day, and this man, Kenny, becoming her husband, her spouse, and the man that she loves. I just hope that when she gets to alter she makes the decision that's right for her heart in this moment and knows that she is walking into a very good relationship. The risks, the great risks in life, you got to take that jump. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Give me a hug. I love you. Y'all been drinking? Yeah, we've been drinking a little bit. - Come here, baby. - I'm being responsible. Oh... How are you doing? A little anxious. - You anxious? - A little bit. So, how you doing? Is this your little journal? This is my journal, yeah. Just writing some notes, thoughts. - So what are you thinking? - In the past... Uh... I'm just excited. It's all positive things because it's just that next step for me and her to take and continue our journey together. The greatest advice I can give you is to ask God to let you see your spouse - through His eyes. - Yeah. It feels surreal to be the mother of a groom in a situation like this. I love that Kenny is getting married, and I'm excited because family is the most important thing to me, and I can see Kelly fitting into our family. So that makes me very happy. I'm so glad you're our son. You're good, Mom. My only son. I just want you to find somebody who loves you as much as I do. She does and I'm so thankful for it. That's what this has showed me. - Well, you know it. Love you. - I'm down here crying in basements. - I know. - Yeah. I need some wine. - Hi, honey. - Hi, I can take your bag. Thank you. - Aww. - You look pretty. So do you. You look beautiful. Thank you. Today, I am the mother of the bride. It's exciting. It's very exciting. - It looks real pretty. - Thank you. Thank you. Don't mess up your makeup. - It looks gorgeous. - You do. I don't want to cry. - It's okay, you can cry. - No, because you look too pretty. Don't cry. You're going to make me cry. - But you're happy? And excited? - Yeah. - Okay. - I'm okay. After I put my dress on and everything, it feels surreal. It does feel like that fairy tale that every little girl... imagined. Aww. These are so pretty. I love Kenny, and getting married to someone is a freaking big deal, and it is going to be emotional. I'm already preparing myself for that. All right. Here we go. Here we go. We'll never give in ♪ The last time I did this was 32 years ago. - Walking down the aisle? - With my dad. It's uh... It is nerve-wracking. His arm was vibrating the entire time. - Am I vibrating? - No, you're good. - Yeah. - You're good. I still feel this same love that I've had for Kelly this entire time. She is exactly the woman that I've been looking for. I mean, I feel certain about what I'm about to, you know, do. So above anything else, I'm just excited. - Love you. - I love you. Ready to walk? Yes, I'm ready. There's no turning back ♪ - How's it going? - Good. Hey. How y'all doing? I don't know if it's appropriate, but I'm gonna talk to you all either way. Nice to see you. Yeah, nice to finally... Nice to see you again. - Nice to see you. - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Four glasses of champagne, I'm good. Oh, dear. Here it is... the land of no return. Kenny is extremely supportive, and he's my best friend, my confidant, my person. Having a partner to love for the rest of my life means... everything, and it's a very big commitment. And I am definitely not taking it lightly. So I'm just very anxious. Um, just want to let you know how proud I am of you. - Thank you. - I really am. I know, I know. - I love you. - I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please rise for the bride? Changed my life forever ♪ than I could have ever imagined like, this is me and her. Thank you, man. You may be seated. Family and friends, we are gathered here today for something amazing: holy matrimony. Marriage. Love is unpredictable, especially in these circumstances. The both of you fell in love and got engaged sight still unseen. It was all based on just your deep connection, your emotional connection that you guys made. It became clear in a short amount of time that Kenneth and Kelly found exactly what they were looking for. You know, not only did we meet um, by complete happenstance and to have thought that going into this experiment that we would be here right now is unbelievable and I know that everyone that is here, uh, for the most part, are blind supporters of you, and I want you to understand that. You know, we haven't had an opportunity to talk to the majority of people in this room, or for them to meet you, and for them to meet me, and it doesn't matter, right? Because we know what we've experienced. I have nothing but love for your family, that we have their support, and they're here for us, thick and thin, and the only thing that also matters is that I will always be here for you. No matter what. And I can't wait to be a continued part of your life. I'm going to cry. This experiment, um... I mean, it brought me to you, someone who is so fabulous in every single aspect. You know, and, and this has been a wild ride, and I am grateful that it has... been with you because you've been nothing but supportive, and I appreciate every single moment that I shared with you. And I love you. I know. Now is the time to decide if love is blind. Together in the presence of friends and family, we will discover if you will walk together in life as husband and wife, or walk away from each other forever. Kelly, do you take Kenneth to be your lawful wedded husband, to live together in the holy estate of matrimony? Will you love him, comfort him, honor and keep him, in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, committed only to him, so long as you both shall live? I absolutely adore you and love you. I love you. But I don't. I can't marry you. Um... and I hope that you can appreciate that and respect that decision of mine. Thank you. Obviously, this is just a whirlwind for everyone, and again, don't want to dive too deep into it, and delve... Because you take something that is so complex, and it is authentic, and it is real, but today is not our day. Um, but I love each and every one of y'all, and it's something that I'll cherish and be grateful for forever. God, I love this guy. Yeah. I know that wasn't easy for you, vand mom and dad especially. It's okay. I had to be the one to say ""I don't."" That's not easy. I'm 33. I should know what the fuck I want right now. Excuse my language, but I should know what I want. And I... And he's checking off every box, but my love... My, my feelings for him were not as intense as his apparently are for me. So, I really do love you. - And I appreciate you being here. - I love you, too. Yeah, me too. You still wanna marry her in the future? I really can't answer that question now. And it's completely... You have to respect the fact that I'm telling you this. I don't know, and please stop recording this, because it's not... It's... That's wrong. - What? - What you're asking me. How you feel about Kelly? This is not about how I feel about Kelly. I'm not going to have things filmed. Please stop recording, Jimmy. We're not getting married. I don't know if we're going to maintain a relationship, and, quite honestly, it doesn't matter either way. But I'm not going to speak to that. So you don't know if you're going to stay with her? It doesn't matter. I'm not answering that. Just... it's very upsetting. It all fell down ♪ It all fell down ♪ It's my wedding day and I couldn't be happier. Six weeks ago, I was looking for the can't-eat, can't-sleep, over-the-fence, World Series-type of love, and I have it. I found full-blown love like I've never experienced before. You know, having Mark by my side, who is such an amazing incredible person... He's changed me for the better and that is why you marry someone. It's my wedding day. Wow. It's kind of... to say that. I was so sure from the first time I heard Jess' voice, I knew that she was the one. And, honestly, to have that kind of emotional connection with someone without ever even seeing them is the most amazing thing that's ever happened to me. I feel like I made the right decision. I couldn't imagine going through this with anybody else. How's the bump? So good. I like it. I like it a lot. It's perfect. It's not too much, but it's just enough. Yeah. - You like it? - Yeah, I like that. In just a few hours from now, we'll be walking down the aisle, exchanging vows, and I'm just ready. I'm more ready than ever. I couldn't have asked to be in this with anyone else. Jessica, you have my heart and there's nobody in this world that I would rather spend the rest of my life with. Will you marry me? Yes. - Of course I will. - I want to kiss you. I want to hug you. - I love you. - Oh, God. Today, has been, like, the most important day, I think, throughout this entire thing because I just feel you. - We're finally being ourselves. - Yeah. I'm definitely on the same page. You know, I felt much more closer to you right now than I have. You embody everything that I've ever wanted, and I realized that tonight. I love you, babe. Loves ya. - Whoa! - What up? - What's up? - What up? What's up, dude? My guys being here in support of my relationship with Jess... - What's up, dude? - What's up, bro? That to me means the world because I think, at first, we're worried about what they're gonna say, but when they support you, it's just... I couldn't be happier. Salud. Cheers! I'm glad you guys are here. Seriously. - Hello. - Hey. - Look at you, pretty girl. - Hi, beautiful. - You look so good! - And gorge. You guys look so pretty. You look beautiful. You look perfect. I feel like a bride today. Obviously, I've got the dress, and I feel all those little butterflies. Oh! All right. I think I've got a really good support system and I'm feeling great. I know that you've been hopeful that this is all going to work out and I actually admire that about you because I'm the type of person that's, like, if I don't know for sure something's going to happen, I shut it down and I keep myself out of it so I don't get hurt. So what are you hoping is going to happen today? You know, for me, what I hope... I'll start off with that. What I hope happens today is we say ""I do."" If she says ""yes,"" I know I can be the man I need to be. She says ""no,"" it's going to hurt. It's going to be... it's going to be painful, but I know where I stand, and no matter what has had happened, the ups, the downs, the hot, the cold, when I see her, it's still the same. She's my person. How are you? - Um... - Are you excited? I'm excited. Mm-hmm. I'm nervous too, but I'm excited. Mm-hmm. Mark is everything I've ever wanted. I definitely, wholeheartedly, fell in love more so than I've ever been, but the person I fell in love with in the pod, where it was so insulated and you were just having an emotional conversation and an emotional connection, was a totally different experience in the real world. I'm someone who wants kids. Dude, if I'm 24, I don't want to be having kids in, like, a year. You know? - Like, that's, like... - Look. ...very young. Just... It doesn't bother me. It doesn't scare me. I don't think the age matters. I think the thing for me is, like, my 20's were so amazing. With him, I'm, like, are you sure that you would want to give that up? I mean, that's a really prime time of your life. In the outside world, I would have never looked twice at Mark. I would have, you know, figured out his age or maybe that he was a fitness instructor, and that would be something maybe I wouldn't have been into. Usually, I am someone who runs before a commitment, but Mark has exceeded every expectation. Taking those vows, it's a huge commitment, and it's something I take very seriously. Hello. - What's up? - What's up, my baby? - Hi. - How are you, my love? I'm good. Yeah? You're ready? Yeah. Wow. Wow. Oh, God. - Are you going to pass out? - No, I'm not. If you are going to pass out, you have to let me know. It's crazy. I'm about to walk down the aisle. If Jess says... If Jess says ""I do,"" I mean, that ""yes"" would mean the world. That's my woman. That's my little person who I fought for the entire time. But who knows? Maybe she still battling reality to the experience. And if she says no, it's going to hurt. It's going to be physically painful. Game time. No turning back now. Baby, I love you with all my heart. God bless you. I think he cares a lot for her, so I'm hoping that she feels the same. That's my best hope. I always put everything in God's hands. Everything happens for a reason. - Let's run away. - No, probably not. - You and I. Come on. - Ah, we're here now. Nope, we're good. You guys, please welcome your groom. Good luck. Come on. Today, we celebrate love. You guys, please rise for the bride. Fuck. I don't see the external. I see her soul, I see everything. - We're not supposed to do that yet. - Oh, sorry. We are gathered here to celebrate something very special, the joining together of two lives into holy matrimony, better known as marriage. Jessica and Mark, in this blind love experiment, you chose to get engaged and spend the rest of your lives together with someone you had not seen. True love grew, not from what you look like on the outside, but what you saw on the inside of each other. - It's okay. - Jessica, I want you to know that no matter what the ups, the downs, the highs, the lows, is that I've loved you from the first time that you said, ""Hey,"" which is crazy to even say. I walked in that room and I knew that you were different from the rest. It's been, you know, a lot. I love that. Mark. Marky Mark. Thank you for putting me here. You've been my rock since day one, not just because you felt like home, but because you opened me up to new experiences, talking about things that I had never opened up about. And you really pushed me. You changed me for the better. Thank you for being so open, so consistent with me, and always being my biggest cheerleader. I love you. I love you. Jessica, Mark, this is the time to make a commitment to be husband and wife, or walk away from each other forever. Now's the time to decide if love is blind. Mark Anthony Cuevas, do you take Jessica Nicole Batten to be your lawful wedded wife, to live together in the holy estate of matrimony? Will you love her, comfort her, honor and keep her, in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live? I do. Jessica Nicole Batten, do you take Mark Anthony Cuevas to be your lawful wedded husband, to live together in the holy estate of matrimony? Will you love him, comfort him, and keep him, in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live? I love you. I cannot. I'm so proud of us for... getting through the ups and downs, but I don't think either one of us is ready to take this on, but I do want you to know that I do love you so very much, and I've always been truthful with you because I respect you so much as a man. And you always have a very special place in my heart. - So embarrassing for her. - I know, right? Oh, fuck. All I want you to be is okay. Listen, listen. I don't... Like, I am going to be okay. - That's all I need, baby. - And I don't... I'm gonna be okay. I'm not... Whatever happens, like... Again, I'm going to be okay. Because that's all I have shown is strength throughout all of this, I am going to continue to be that. - That's all I want. - And I'm going to be okay. That's all I need to know. That you are going to be okay. I'm going to be fine, Mom. Because, you know... Me, I'm there for you. - I know. - Day and night. And we can talk and we can cry together because, as your mom, I feel... my heart, you know... My baby. Forget everything ♪ Having to say no to someone at the altar is not anything anyone ever wants to do, but I'm not walking out of here with reservations, with a wedding band on my finger. There's no way in hell. Like, I've been around the block, my parents are divorced, and I'm too much of a realist to take this big of a chance. I'm not going to do it. And I guess I'll apologize to whoever I need to apologize to, but I'm not going to apologize to myself because I'm not actually sorry. I'm going to be okay. And life is our glory ♪ And life is our glory ♪ Oh, my God. This is so pretty. - Hi, I'm Lauren. - Hi, Lauren. I'm Nat. - So you guys are my glam team? - Yes! Okay, get me together. Get me together, okay? I can't believe that I'm actually here, like, on this day, my wedding day. Oh, the dress. This is unreal. It is just crazy to think that, you know, a couple months ago, I was single. I was living the life. And the journey has just brought me here. Oh, my gosh. Cameron. I let it show ♪ Before, I wasn't really that happy, to be honest. I think it was because I felt that I was missing you. Aww. This just feels like nothing that I've ever experienced because I've never had a man so, just, willing to... show me how much he loves me. Mm. I never thought this day would come. I never thought, going into this experiment, that I would ever meet someone, let alone be standing here, ready to get married. - How's it going? - Good, buddy. - Nice to see you. - Thanks for coming down. Today is obviously one of the biggest days of my life, and the decision of whether or not to get married... I mean, it's going to change the whole trajectory of not just my life, but Lauren's life. Mother! - Hey, sweetie! - Hey, Mom! - How are you? - Good. Isn't this just wonderful? It is. Knowing Lauren, she'll try certain things just to see how it goes, but I can't say I'm totally confident because I've only seen them together for a couple hours, and this is an experiment, so... we'll see how it turns out. So, how do you feel? Nervous. I don't know. I never thought that I would see this day so soon. I feel a lot of different emotions right now. I mean, I'm happy, I'm excited. But, I mean, there's still a part of me that's very terrified. Even a little part of me that may feel a little unsure. Oh, really? Oh, Lauren. Don't cry. Cameron has made me feel unlike any man that I've ever known. We truly and honestly connected on levels so deep, but right now I'm still undecided. I think I won't really decide until the words actually come out of my mouth, and, regardless of what that decision is, I just hope that it's the best choice for me and Cameron. I felt so calm up until today, and now I'm starting to feel a little nervous. So what are you nervous about? I guess I'm just nervous about whether... she still wants to get married. Um, well, you already know that you're, like, the first white guy I've dated. Uh-huh. I want it to be your home. Yeah, you want me to live here with you? I do. I would love to. I do love my place. How would you feel if I kept it? Um, well... I don't know. Damn. The invitations just... make everything, like, you know... It's no turning back now. It's like, just pressure. We're getting married in not that much time. And, I mean, I still don't know completely what you're going to say. And I don't want to say a definite answer. I think that she's ready now, but... I don't know. I don't know for sure. - Hi. - Hi. - Tiffany and Rachel! - Hi. My bridesmaids are here. My good friend Tiffany,... Look at this coat. ...and my first cousin Rachel. I love the fact that they're here to support me and my decision, no matter what it is, so that means a lot to me. Don't want anything, but ♪ - All right, mom, you're good. - Oh, all right. He looks like James Bond. Cameron Bond, right there. This is my way of... - I guess... - What? Yeah, I'm ready for a beer. This is crazy. I know. We were in Paris, living our best life. I know. Then I came home and got married. You just pop up like, ""Hey, girl. Let's get something to eat."" And she's like, ""I'm engaged and I want you to be a bridesmaid."" All within, eating the same... - What was it? Salad? - In the same bread. - Yeah, like what the heck? - In the same salad. This is crazy. Okay, Momma. Look at you! All right! Whose wedding is it, mine or yours? And she's coming in shrugging her shoulders. Yeah. Hi, everyone. - Hey, Mom. - Hi. Wow, they've got you in the wine cellar? - How nice. How nice. - Yeah. - Oh, baby, how are you doing? - Good, how are you, Mom? Mm, I don't even know. - Can I say that? - Yeah, you can say anything. I'm really happy that I'm getting some time with my mom. This is the hardest for her, and she feels like she's losing her baby boy. How are you feeling? Are you feeling okay about it? Not worried about anything? Let's just hope that she is still... still on board. You think she might not be? Uh... I mean, this is a crazy situation in many respects, so I don't think there'd be any shame if she said no or didn't, you know, whatever. Yeah. - I wouldn't blame her. - But you would be devastated. - Of course I'd be devastated, yeah. - Yeah. With Lauren, in no time at all, I knew I wanted to marry her, so if she were to say no, I don't know how long it would be until I would be all right again. Or if I would ever be all right again. I am taking a leap of faith. Even in the... you know, most sure situations, it is still a leap of faith. Yeah. Oh, boy. It's a big step. Did you ever think about me getting married? Um... No. You know, because you're still 12 in my mind. - Yeah. - You know. So, um, I'd like you to be 12 again. You know, I will always be your son. - We love you. - I love you too. We want the best for you, and I don't want your heart to be broken. I know. Okay, how does that feel? Oh, my God. Feels tight. - Tight? - I mean, but that's good I guess. Oh, my God. You look so pretty. Thank you. Okay, Mom. - That fits like a glove. - It does. This is it. - Okay. - I'm in the dress now. - No turning back. - Are your knees, like, knocking? My heart is like beating real hard. The thought of... me being a married woman, like, within the next hour gives me crazy anxiety. This is a wonderful, beautiful day, and we are so truly blessed, and we pray that our life, Lauren's life, and Cameron's life will come together as one. You know, it's a lifelong commitment, and I don't think that it's anything to play with, and I take it very seriously. - Daddy! - Hi, baby. Hi, Daddy. Don't cry. You look beautiful. You look beautiful. Look at you. Look at my baby. I'm so thankful I can stand here and see you like this. - You look absolutely beautiful. - Thank you, Daddy. She's my princess still, and I guess when you have those moments, when you think about one day, she's going to grow up, and get married, and have a husband, and that day comes when you have to walk down the aisle, and let her go, let her go into the world. So, you know, a little nervous, a little excited, and a little just plain scared. Needless to say, I've loved you since you've been in this world. From the moment I looked at you when you were born. Since you've been in this world, you know, we've been like this. My dad is a huge focal point in my life. He's so loving, so it's definitely a sigh of relief to have my dad here to support me. - I'm sorry. - It's okay, Daddy. - I'm trying. I'm really trying. - I know. You're not losing me. Well, you're still my daughter. But you're gonna be this man's wife. Just let me in every time I knock, that's all. I love you so much. - I love you too, Daddy. - I love you so much. - I love you, honey. - I love you, Mom. In just moments now, I'm going to go to the altar, Lauren's going to walk down that aisle, and she's either going to say yes and we're going to spend the rest of our lives together as husband and wife, or... maybe she'll say no, and that might be the end. the biggest decision of my life. only six weeks ago, to follow my own comfort that every little girl dreams of. - I love you, sweetheart. - I love you too, Daddy. He's a lucky man. Please stand as we bring in our beautiful bride. - Love you, sweetheart. - Love you, too. Who gives this woman to be married to this man? I do. - You look amazing. - Thank you. Every day that we've spent together has been a blessing to me. There's so much I love about you. I'm sorry I'm crying, but... It's okay. I have been crying all day. You made me want to be a better man, and you have everything that I need in a partner. I feel very blessed to have you in my life. That's beautiful. Cameron, I love that you... make me feel comfortable being fully myself. No matter how flawed, goofy, or broken I may have been. I'm thankful for our time together and how happy our moments are. I've never had a man love me as purely and selflessly as you have. I'm grateful for the things that have made me uncomfortable and forced me to grow. Nice. I'm grateful for you. Mine’s more short, but I meant it, damn it, I meant... I'm sorry. Pastor, I didn't mean to curse. I didn't mean to curse, Lord, Jesus. Okay. Lauren and Cameron... ...now is the time to decide if love is truly blind. Your love developed in an untraditional way, based on an intense emotional connection. Looks, money, age, and race that might be important to some people was not a factor for you two.

I promise I'm going to take care of you, baby. I know you will, baby. You know what? I don't think that I ever could have met someone like Cameron any other way. I've been looking for Cameron for 30 years! Apparently, he was looking for me, too. I'm glad we finally found each other. Oh, hey! Hey, everybody! Oh, beautiful. You're beautiful. This is my husband, Cameron. It's my gorgeous wife, Lauren. - Oh! - Amazing woman. ♪ I've been searching ♪ ♪ And looking ♪ ♪ And wishing ♪ ♪ And dreaming ♪ She has everything that I've always dreamed about in a partner. She's charismatic, but she's down-to-earth. She's confident, but she's also humble. She's intelligent. She's kind. I'm just so thankful that we got to meet each other through this albeit unorthodox method. I fell in love with Lauren without ever having seen her. It's amazing to say Lauren is my wife. I'm happy I locked it down. I absolutely believe that love is blind. Six weeks ago, I was extremely hopeful. I had an open mind, but I can say honestly I did not expect for things to go this far. I mean, that was my hope and dream, but this is bigger than anything I could have ever imagined. You know, I'm just grateful for everything. This experience and experiment truly changed my life. I came into this hoping to find someone that loves me for what's on the inside. Even though Jessica and I did not get married, I strongly believe that love is blind because I made that commitment to propose through just an emotional connection. I think if she had remembered that, I think we would have been all right. For your and I ♪ When I was in the pods, I was in my feelings so much that the outside world didn't exist to me. I grew so much. I challenged myself. I got so far out of my comfort zone. And I connected with someone so deep, I could have never imagined. But I couldn't translate that from pod to real life. For some people, love might be blind. But for me, it's definitely not. It's a mixture of... mind, body, and soul, and I never got there. So that's really hard. That hold together a broken heart ♪ I believe that soulmates can come and go into your life, that they're not always there forever. Um, you learn lessons from people that touch your soul in so many different ways, but in the end, making the right decision for you is the right decision for everybody. We could try for a better way ♪ We won’t cry for our yesterdays ♪ You sit and you want to have a pity party. There's no pity party because I have ultimate control. There's more nice people than there are bad. So yeah, like, I will have my day, and I'll be with that person I need to be with, but today is not that day. We could cry for our yesterday ♪ We could try for a better way ♪ I never thought that I would find my soulmate in a dark room. I don't regret anything. I'm mourning, but from the ashes comes... the phoenix. We could try for a better way ♪ that one moment of greatness It was a relief to see that he was actually at the end of the aisle waiting for me. I was really happy I wasn't going to spend the rest of my life in jail. Considering, where I was in life right before I came into this experience, I would never in a million years have guessed that I would be in a wedding gown right now with a ring on my finger and a whole new last name. I wouldn't have believed it. Uh... - Was that right? - Here you go. No regrets. Not today. Maybe... we'll see. We'll see down the road. I'm just kidding. Six weeks ago, I was hopeful, but skeptical of this experiment, and now I'm a full-on believer. I'm beyond elated. And that's it. I'm off the market, baby. The fact that Cameron and I found each other without ever even seeing each other, it's like what we saw was each other's soul, and that's the most beautiful thing that I've ever experienced in my life."
