Love On The Spectrum,01,01,"What do you think love is? It'll be like a fairy tale. A natural high, I suppose? Gets your heart racing. Can make people do crazy things. You just feel very warm inside yourself as a person. So, have you ever been in love? No. Have you been in a relationship? No. Have you been on a date? No. That was too awkward. Some girls don't feel like dating with someone with disabilities. Beep, beep, bi, boop. An A-plus partner looks like me. Oh! Would you like to get married? Um... ""The course of true love never did run smooth."" Of course it doesn't. You ready? Yes, ready. Hello. My name is Michael, and I happen to be a 25-year-old man. How do you feel about being on the spectrum? Well, autism is just a neurological disability. People with Asperger's or autism, they just learn things a different way. As far as I'm concerned, if anything, it's actually more of a gift. And are you looking for love, Michael? Oh, yes, I am. I would like to start dating. I just, um... don't really know how to get started, because... I've tried numerous ways, and they've all been unsuccessful. What's your greatest dream in life? To become a husband. can be difficult. This room here is my bedroom, but I actually call it my quarters. It's the main place in this world that I feel safe. These are my love ducks. If you are single and seeking love, sit them beside your bed and love is sure to come your way. I actually bought them from a store in Newtown six years ago. Excuse me a second, gentlemen. Oh, what is that? It's a plaque. I actually made it specifically for my future wife. When did you make this? Five years ago. Wow, you really want this, Michael! Oh, yes, I do. It's most important thing that I want to achieve. Well, I hope we can help you achieve that. I really hope so, too. I seriously do. his first dating experience I often compare myself to Adam, my brother, a lot, which is a big mistake. I would often label him as a fresh cut of meat from God, and myself as a double scoop of dog shit. Why on earth he wanted to compare himself to me, I don't know, but... It's because I've often felt inferior to my brother. Adam was able to get himself in a relationship easily, whereas I had trouble doing so. The challenges that you face, Mike, I think a lot of other people face, too. To struggle at some point or another to find, like, proper love. But for some strange reason, I don't seem to recall Adam having any problems like that. Because we're all different. But Michael, you've seen over the past few years, how it just hasn't worked out for me either. Like, it just turns to shit. That's also because a lot of people our age aren't interested in commitment. They're only interested in intercourse. Yeah. Look, it's true. Oops. Dad, did you drop your food? Yeah. And also... I've also... What I've also noticed with a lot of girls your age, Liv, when they're still in high school, they only want a boyfriend for... Intercourse. Not just... Not just for intercourse, but also as a bodyguard and as a sugar daddy. I think every family needs a Michael. It just adds something different. Hi, I'm Chloe. I'm 19, and I'm autistic. I was born, well, not completely deaf, but never been able to hear fully. I have hearing aids, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Have you ever been in love? N... Not romantic love. I don't know what it's like to fall in love or have a crush. So, have you ever dated? Yes, I have. I once dated a guy who, when I told him that I was autistic, he left me, because he didn't want to be associated with someone who's autistic. How did that make you feel? Well, I was a bit... angry, or I was confused. I was like, is autism really bad? And you accept your autism? Yes, I do. Took me a while, but I do, yes. When I tell someone I'm autistic, people go, ""Really? No, you're not. You don't look autistic."" And I can say, ""What does an autistic person look like?"" less likely than boys to be diagnosed. as we learn more I want to experience love. I want to be like everyone else, you know? I just don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I see so many people holding hands and kissing and doing all that, and that's something I want. I had, like, all these ideas in my head, and none of them happened. Life is not a movie. What's up, man? Come here. When you start doing the whole dating thing, that fairy-tale thing, it's gonna take a while to get to that. Yeah, I know. So, you know, don't expect that as the first one, because it's not an easy situation to get into. I'd like someone who I can talk to about Marvel, or, you know... Exactly. ...new cartoons and animes coming out. So, I'll go and crack on and start doing some dinner stuff. Remember, not touching. It won't be touching, Chloe. It won't be touching, I promise. I'm very picky when it comes... I don't like things touching other things. The beans have to be separated. Like, a little bit of beans on the side, they can't touch. All right, let them start warming. She's a really intelligent girl. She's, you know, incredibly intelligent, but socially, she's not. She's often had a lot of problems with difficulties reading someone's emotions. It's a lot harder to make a friendship. So, to move onto anything intimate, I think it would be a huge challenge. From the little girl that couldn't say any words to me, to the day she said ""daddy"" for the first time, to where she is now, yeah, I'm hugely proud of where she's come from. She's... She's done fantastically. She's, um... yeah. After everything she's had against her. Yep, sorry. No, you're all right. Yeah, no, she's done really well. I used to get bullied quite a lot in school in England for how I look. I got called names, I got pushed, I had, you know, my work ripped up, and called me deaf, and then I got called ""skeleton."" I think, you know, being bullied has made me who I am, and if I wasn't bullied, I would've been someone completely different. several times a week. Do you want milkshake or tea? A tea. A tea? Yeah. Yeah? What do you want? I don't know. Same as you. Yeah. Yeah. My friend Brodie has Down's syndrome, and she's mute and deaf, but she signs, and I sign a lot, and we're like this. You know, can't separate us. And we cause... We get told we cause a lot of trouble, and... You know, we just don't follow the rules. Oh, look, Brodie, boy! You like him? You gonna talk to the boys? Come on. Come on. Come on, talk to the boys. No, you! You! Hey. Want to talk? Hello. Come here. I don't know their names. Cheeky. You're cheeky. No, you're cheeky. A lot of things happen when me and Brodie go out. I just think she's this amazing person, and she's absolutely amazing to be around. I just find it sad that some people just look at her for, you know, what she looks like, and just, uh... you know, judges her. Yeah, you're cheeky. Hello. Um, my name is Ruth Garlick, and, uh, I'm 22 years old, and, um... I'm primarily a deaf autistic. And who's this? What's this? Oh, this is my baby snake Cleopatra. She helps me to stay calm. And it means I don't have a lot of sensory overload when I'm handling her. Can you describe your ideal partner? Oh, sure, um... My ideal... ideal partner would be a blondie who's a big cuddler. He also needs to be able to be okay with my quirks and my nerdiness. He's just over there. Come along. Hey, gorgeous. Hello. I'm Thomas. We've been, um, dating for... about four years now, and I think we do all right together. Thomas, what do you love about Ruth? She's funny, fun to be with, um... r-really smart... a-a-a killer body, and just puts up with me. Yeah, he loves my body, that's why he stays with me. I... I really do. It's sexy. Sexy. I think we do work well together. I'm autistic enough to understand Ruth, and she can understand me back. Likening it to curry, she's a very spicy chicken tikka masala, but I'm... I'm a nice... nice mild, um, butter chick... No, I'm a... I'm a mango chicken. I've decided I want to be a mango chicken. Yeah, so basically, I'm fire, and he's water. And together, fire and water, things get steamy. That's true. That's very naughty. Yes, it is. just over a year ago. This is my card collection. This here's thick. So it's quite heavy. This is one of my favorite sections, which is food. So you collect business cards? Yes, I do. What's your guess at how many you have? How many? Um, probably thousands. Look, there's... This is a lot. I can't wait to sort them all out. I don't think I've ever met anyone who collects business cards. Well, autistic people are known for being pretty unusual. This is my garden railway. A garden is your own idea of heaven. So, of course, mine's gonna have a train running through it. When did you guys first meet? My sister told me that, um, she knew another aspie at church, and, uh, she wanted me to meet him, because she thought we'd become friends. We immediately understood each other. We... And I actually... When we first met each other, I wrote in my journal, ""Oh, I want to marry this guy."" I didn't know that. That's true. I told you that before. Likes her milk. That's why I need to go buy some. What's that picture on the fridge? That one? Hmm. Ruth drew that for my birthday. ""Happy birthday, Tom, from your crazy girlfriend Ruthy."" And then that is, um, runes. Can't wait to marry you. I love you, Ruth. Apparently, it says that. If I actually was dating somebody, and I actually entered a relationship, and then eventually... married her, I would treat her as my top priority. She would be pretty much my most valuable and greatest treasure of all time. She'd practically be my million dollars. Mike, can you get me some salt? Yeah. You mean the sea salt? Yep. Please. Why do you think Michael's finding it hard to meet someone? I think he just needs to find somebody that's like-minded. I don't think he wants anybody loud. Or gothic. Mm-hmm. Or tomboyish. Mm-hmm. Or practically any girl that acts like... like she's still in high school. Yeah. Sounds right. If she's the right person for me, then... I'll... I'll consider proposing to her. Okay. By coincidence, I've already decided on the perfect wedding ring for my partner. In the form of a crown... to signify that she'll be my queen, per se. But I'm not really too keen on kids at the moment, because... I have a feeling that having children will ruin my chances of becoming wealthy. They kinda do. But what if you meet a girl that wants to have children, and you're like, ""Oh, but that's gonna take away from my bank account."" What are you gonna do? I'll simply tell her, ""Okay, I'll allow it, but on one condition. I get a vasectomy after the second child."" Okay. I've been single for 25 years. I'm not too willing to be single for another 25. What if you are? Mum. I still refuse to take that for an answer. But it's not an answer. I'm just saying, it's a hypothetical what-if. Not what if. It will. Okay. That's it. Not what if. It will. It will. Okay. It will. who works with people on the spectrum. When they're children, there's a lot of support given to people with autism about social skill and social interaction. And I think when people reach adulthood, and they're really looking for intimate relationships, I think that we don't give a lot of support to understanding the really great complexity... ...of flirting with somebody else, or how do we develop an intimate relationship with somebody else? Hello. Hello. You must be Jodi. Yes, hello. Are you Michael? Yes, I am. Where do people meet each other when they're on the autism spectrum? People go onto sort of a mainstream dating site, and then do you out yourself as being on the spectrum, which is really complex? I've never had a partner before. I've always had some trouble trying to find a partner. Why do you think that is? Well, a lot of girls that I've been friends with in the past, a... a lot of those friendships have turned out to be quite... disappointing. Do you have trouble with understanding another person's body language? I have very little trouble. Facial expressions always give something away. That's great. It's excellent that you say that. Because some people on the spectrum, they really have difficulty with that. So that's excellent that you've got that ability to do that. Yeah. Yes. When I'm with somebody, if they're trying to mask... mask something... He knows. ...on their face, I'll just simply say, mask it all you want, but I know what you're actually feeling. Yes! Really? He... And you know what, he's so good at it. He's so... Even with people he's just met. I've been studying human behavior for many years. That's excellent, Michael. Specifically in women. Yeah. Oh. It's because I've always taken a bit of an interest in it, in a... in a strange way. No, that's not strange. Do you know what, if you're on the autism spectrum, and you find body language difficult, actually studying body language is a really important thing to do. I was told that nonverbal cues, he'll never be able to get. Excuse me, nonverbal cues? Look at his gift. I was told, ""Oh, you know, you'll... you'll probably never hear him say I love you."" They said he probably won't have any empathy for others. Biggest bunch of rubbish I ever heard. It's just a difference in the way that they do things. They're just different, that's it. And people with autism have incredible affection... Yes. ...and deep love. Yes! Really wanting to connect. When people talk to Michael, they might find him a bit of an oddball, a bit quirky, and stuff like that. But the thing is, we've raised him and taught him... to be confident with himself, and that, you know what? Even as so-called ""normal people,"" we don't have all the answers. But you two have obviously done a really, really fantastic job as parents. They haven't given me everything. Not everything, but plenty. Which is still adequate. Which is still adequate? Yes. Yep. What's the difference between... friendship and a girlfriend? Girlfriends, they're more serious, it's more intimate, and there's no hands-to-yourself business. Okay, hang on, hang on. So, it's more... Because that's... Tell me the difference. It's more serious... What do you mean by more serious? When I say serious... Yeah. ...you make the decision to... Yeah. ...to kiss each other or, um... We don't talk to Mum and Dad about kissing, do we? No. N-Not... Not really. I never really thought about that. Because, you see, I've never... never had any interest in having... in having sexual intercourse as... if you will. Um... Okay, this is where I exit. Yeah. I have to say, that could be a good time. Thanks very much for coming. We'll leave you guys to it. And, like, one of my philosophies is, never fall for a girl just because she's hot. I think that's an excellent philosophy. I made that up myself. Did you? It's a good... It's a very good one. So, when we're going on a first date, what we're doing is we're trying to find out have we got enough things in... ...common. ...common. What would be one thing that you can think of if you could make a girlfriend, what would be something that you're into and that she's into? There is a hobby that I enjoy doing. I actually tend to do this one in secret. That's toy collecting. If you don't have enough things in common, what do we do? Not bother with another date. We don't just give up, we keep going, because we just have to keep finding... Yeah. ...that person that's gonna be your person with enough in common with you. Yeah. I'd really like for you to let me know how you go on your dates, and especially to find out if you've been able to find somebody that you have common interest with. Okay. It was lovely to meet you. Like... Likewise. Take care of yourself. See ya. And good luck. Thanks. Thanks for your time. Are you open to dating people who might have a disability or a condition? Oh, yes. And I think dating someone who's on the autistic spectrum, or someone, you know, with disabilities might be better. I might... I might have, um... be able to talk to them more about it and not feel like I have to be fake and be someone completely different. Hello. Hello, miss. Yeah. If you need to, just, you know, twiddle your fingers or something, if you're getting a little bit nervy. And you can always excuse yourself, you need to powder your nose or something. Okay, but I don't have nose powder. No, no. It's... It's a saying, isn't it. You go for... go for a wee. Oh, okay. But it's not honest. That's true. Maybe you could say, I'm just gonna just pop to the bathroom. Okay. And you can have a little bit of time. Okay. All right? Just... Just ask him what he likes, and... boom, if there's a connection, it's a connection. Hmm. between his toes. Hello. Hello. I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Here you go. Oh, thank you so much. They're lovely. Thank you. Thank you. So, how are you? I'm pretty good. Yeah? You nervous? Yeah, I am. What do you like? Do you have any hobbies? I like to go to, um... to the gym. Oh, gym? To be honest, I have never set foot in a gym. Mmm. Never. Not my thing. Yeah. So, do you like reading? Like, do you know any good books? I do read sometimes, but not a lot... Yeah. ...because, um... Well, actually, I didn't learn how to fully read until I was 13. Oh, really? Yeah. I couldn't speak until I was seven. I still have a lisp, but I'm deaf, so... Oh, okay. Autistic, deaf. Yeah. Yeah. Can't speak properly. Yeah, the whole package, I guess. Um... Do you want to go inside for dinner? Yeah, sure. Okay. Oh, she's pretty cool. You know, it's going pretty well so far. I hope it can... only go up from here, you know? So, have you ever, like, dated before? Never. Oh, never? Never. This is the very first one... Oh, really? ...I've ever had, ever. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. So, are you interested in, like, any specific type of person or... I thought I was interested in guys at one point, but then I tried watching a little bit of, uh, gay porn, and... Okay. It didn't... It didn't work out. No? Okay. And I did not like what I saw. Oh, okay. And I didn't feel anything. So, you're sure you're definitely straight? Yeah. Yeah. How about you? Um, well, I'm openly bi, but I dated, uh, a few girls before, a few guys, it's just, you know, I'm just trying to find the right person. True that. Yeah. It's like, um... I like Asians. Oh, Asians? Yeah. Okay. I'm a... I'm an Asian, and... Okay, yeah. I'm not Asian. Okay. I also like Mexicans. I like them, too. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. My, um... Oh. Trout, guys? Um, the steak and the... and the chips. Fish is right over here. Thank you. Thank you. No worries. Enjoy, guys. That's what I'm talking about. Do you like Spider-Man? Yeah, I do. Who's your favorite Spider-Man? Um... Tobey Maguire. Oh. That is my favorite. Oh, you see... I quite like Andrew Garfield, but I think Tom Holland, the current one, he's all right, but... Yeah, he's, um... No, he's an actual kid, so... He's okay. He didn't tickle my fancy. I guess... Hmm. Hm. This has been a really nice date, but I think it's getting a bit late. Thank you. Yeah. I had a nice time tonight. Thank you. Thank you for the flowers, they're lovely. No problem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye! Goodbye. Bye! There wasn't really, like, a spark, and it was a bit awkward for both of us. It's kind of been, like, a learning experience, made me realize I like girls a bit more... than men. Are you guys in love? What'd he say? Are we in love? Um... We're a bit more than in love. Because we were a bit desperate, when we hit rough roads... ...we just decide to cling on even more. It's just nice and warm and comfortable and stable now, I think. Steady. Yeah, yeah. We're comfortable farting in front of each other. Yeah, that. Hello, Munchkin. I've struggled my whole life with friends, and I've mostly really had friends of the animal, imaginary kinds. It would be nice to have a real-life friend, I guess, but I don't know if I will find one. So, for the moment, I've basically just latched onto Tom. That... That one wasn't good enough. We have to do it again. No, we don't! Yes, we do. No, we certainly do not. I love my job. It's really relaxing just driving around, looking at the scenery. Initially, as a railway enthusiast, I was a bit, ""Ew, buses, they're common."" Very, uh, snobbish of me. But I then thought, you know, while I couldn't find work, maybe give them a try. And here I am, and I absolutely love it, uh... Best job I've ever had. Just around the corner is a house Ruth and I are currently dreaming about buying. Really nicely located next to the railway station. It'd be nice to spend the afternoon on the balcony, just watching the buses and the trains driving past. I saw the bus come along, and I just jumped on... ...and then, for some reason, Tom was in free dress... ...and I had no idea why. Aren't you supposed to be in uniform? What? What? What?! Serious? Yeah. I told you I couldn't afford a ring. I already bought it. Really? Yeah. Really?! Oh, for goodness' sake, just put it on! And say yes. Come here. When it comes to physical beauty, my idea is, a woman has to be beautiful, but not to the point where she looks like a model on a runway. Definitely not. That's too beautiful. Pretty much a fifty-fifty-looking girl. That would be the best. by a local disability organization. Hi, Michael. Hello, Tamika. How are you? I'm good, yourself? I'm great. So, what are your hobbies? Ten-pin bowling, pool, um, watching television... Nice. Now, that's nice. Yeah. And what are yours? Mine is basketball, soccer, football... Ever since I was a little girl, I always used to love sport. Ah, so you're a bit of a tomboy type. Correct, I am. Ah. Who's got the Mediterranean pasta? Here. Thank you. That's me. There you are. Thank you. Oh, have any of you seen Yes! ""Oh, SpongeBob. If only you could see how stupid you sound right now."" ""I love money! Money, money, money, money, money."" ""Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab."" ""But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy! And what could be better than serving up smiles?"" Mm-hmm. Are you a beer drinker, Michael? Nope. No? I've always hated beer. I don't even drink wine either. I hate it. Oh, wow. You see, I'm a different kind of man. I'm actually a teddy bear. Aw, that's nice. I like that. Hello. Hello. Name's Michael. Nice to meet you, Michael. I'm Carli. Nice to meet you, Carli. What do you do for work? Um... I... I run my own business. Wow. But sometimes there have been complications. Like, the financial side on the business, it's... become a bit, not blocked, but clogged up. You know what I mean? Yeah. But I've asked a friend of mine, ""Ah, can you fix that?"" ""Yeah, I'll fix it, I know what it is."" Ah. So, I can easily deal with that, 'cause see... Yeah. For instance, I've gotta do it tomorrow morning, because I've... Probably tomorrow afternoon. See if I can keep going on the... on the business stuff. But if it has to wait till the weekend, and then she sees it and goes, ""Oh, yeah, I gotta fix that again."" Yes. So, it's a bit frustrating. Hello. Hi. My name's Michael. Michael. My name's Amanda. You have a very lovely bow. Thank you. And your hairstyle looks lovely as well. Thank you. And, so, tell me, what are your hobbies and interests? I like to collect toys and dolls and things. Seriously? Yep. That's what I like doing as well! Really? I've collected a lot of Thomas the Tank Engine... You like Thomas the Tank Engine? Yeah. I liked it when I was a kid. Yeah. I still like it a bit now. Yeah. Do you have a favorite Thomas character? No, there's too many of them. Yeah. So, how old are you? I'm 25. I'm 21. Have you had your birthday yet? Thank you. No, it's next week. Oh, so you're 22? Yeah, nearly. So, you were born in 1997. Same year Men In Black was released. Is that a movie? Mm-hmm. Yeah. You've heard of Asperger's? Yes. I actually have it. So do I. But mine's mild. So is mine. Wow. I was 13 when I got a diagnosis, so it was my first year of high school. I never knew I had Asperger's until my mother told me when I was 13. That's not too bad. Did she know when you were younger, though? I think so, but I don't know when. Yeah. When I was in primary school, I often sat alone. Yeah. Do you mind if I ask you something? Yeah? Um... I actually enjoy... enjoy talking to you. Me too. I'd like to catch up with you again sometime. You never know... What do you say? Nice. Hello. How's Cleo? What'd he say? How is Cleo? She's all right. She had a shed last night. Do you want me to show you the s-skin? Yeah. All right. Got a surprise for her planned. She doesn't know yet. It's the skin. Whoa. I'm very proud of my little girl. How do you feel about four years together? Yeah, it's cool. No need to sound so excited. Sorry, I'm just... quietly elated. You're a goose. It's like making out with Medusa. That's me. Hello, Thomas. Hello, Ruth. Hello. Congratulations on your fourth anniversary. What's going on? We're going on a date. Is that a Rolls-Royce with coach doors? This one's a vintage 1928 Chrysler. What did he say? It's a Chrysler, but we won't hold that against him. No, we won't. Thanks very much. My pleasure. Do you have a business card? I do. Thanks. Can I have one? You sure can. There you go. Brilliant! Thank you so much. My pleasure. Enjoy your evening. Cheers! What the...? Oh. Hmm. Yeah. Isn't this nice? It's very à la The Bachelor. But it's still very cute. Well... Well, very Bachelor, because it's entirely scripted. Where's my script? Didn't you get it? No! Who didn't email Ruth her script? Sorry, I forgot. I wish I saw the warning signs when I met you. I never professed to be a lady. Good. Oh, that hurts. Oh. You're a cutie patootie. And you have a cute patootie as well. Thanks. You're a really special girl, Ruth. You're very different and very unique. Well, you're a handsome boy. I am a handsome boy. You are. I'm a bit nervous, but excited. Hopefully it'll be love at first sight, or whatever. You know, like in the movies. Hi, are you Chloe? Oh, yeah, I'm Chloe. Are you Lotus? Yeah. Hi. Hi, nice to meet you. Hi. Would you like to sit down? Yes, please. So, um, what kind of stuff are you into, like, movies and stuff? Um, I sort of... I like Sailor Moon, you know, the anime. Oh! I love Sailor Moon.  Yeah. Me too. You do? I kind of stopped watching it for ages, and then got back into it. Oh, it's raining. Okay, I'm gonna put my jacket on. I'm just getting cold. Yeah. So are you, like, bi or lesbian? Yeah, I'm bisexual. I'm both. Okay. Yeah? I thought I was, like, a lesbian for the biggest time, because I didn't feel any attraction towards boys. Yeah. I started to think, maybe it was 'cause the boys at my school were gross. Um... So, are you on the spectrum, too? Yes. I didn't get diagnosed until I was, like, 12. 'Cause, you know, sometimes with girls on the spectrum... It's harder to... Yeah, you get diagnosed later. Hello. We've got a mixed berry smoothie. That's me, thank you. And the iced... And the iced choccy. Thank you. No worries. Yeah, it was kind of weird. When I was acting out, they didn't know what was wrong with me. They thought I was doing that because my parents got divorced. Oh. They were always like, ""The kid's just going through a phase."" Like, I had sensory problems, so I couldn't wear the socks, and I couldn't wear the sweater, and the school was like, ""Oh, she's just being annoying..."" Oh, yeah. Yeah, and... I was hated at my school, absolutely hated, because I would... No one knew, really, what to do. So, there's a sunflower farm, um, down the road. Would you like to go and pick sunflowers? Oh, yeah, sure. What's your favorite flower? Well, my name's Lotus, so... Oh, lotus. So probably a lotus. Yeah. I get it. So, which way's the sunflower park? Oh, down there. Alrighty. I wore the wrong shoes for this. Oh, so did I. Oh, God. Not to be lame, but this reminds me of Minecraft. Oh. Haha, yes, the autistic girl likes Minecraft. This is cool. Like a little hidden spot. Yeah. Feel that. Kinda hurts. Uh... I think it's going well. You know, a lot better than I expected. I really like her, you know. We're, um, talking, getting along. I was expecting, you know, sort of awkwardness, and that we wouldn't have anything to talk about and... Yeah, but we've just been non-stop talking. Got it, thank you. I think I got a little bit nervous, and I have trouble talking when I'm nervous, but I'm hoping that maybe she got that. I just hope she knows that's the case, and not that I was like, ""I don't wanna be here."" Do you see Chloe as someone you could potentially date? Yes. Yeah, um... Yeah, it'd be cool if she thought the same thing. That looks like a little love heart. Oh, it does! Yeah. Quite cute. Yeah. Are you... Are you all right? Oh, yeah, I'm good, sorry. I'm just spacing out. Um... Alrighty, um... Okay. Uh... Do you want this one? Oh, no, you can keep it. Really? Yeah. Okay, thank you. It's cute, I'll put it in my vase. Yeah. Um, well, my mum's here to pick me up. Uh... It was really nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you, too. It'd be cool to see you again. Oh, yeah. I would really like that. Oh, really? Okay, cool. Really, yeah. I was really worried, I didn't know if you liked me. I was... I was worried too, but that's really good. All right, um... Thank you. See ya! Bye! Goodbye. Bye. Are you happy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I can't stop smiling. Yeah. Can you describe for me the perfect relationship? Well, no relationship is perfect, because perfection in a relationship cannot exist in any way. But you can make a relationship a very healthy, stable, loving relationship. And whenever a person is feeling bored or unhappy in their relationship with someone, all they need to do is stop and do one thing that everyone should do: smell the flowers. They don't bloom every day. Wow, how good do you look? Million bucks. That's what I wanna hear. Jeez, I love your shoes, mate. Thanks, Dad. She'll be impressed. Yep. Speaking of which, this bit of paper that Adam gave me, I'll be keeping this on my person. What is it? Just dating points. Oh, okay. Dating advice. ""Be yourself, above all else. Remain focused on your date. Look for changes in the way she responds to indicate if she's interested in the conversation. If she gives you short responses with a flat tone, take this as a sign to change the topic. Keep your face relaxed while maintaining eye contact."" Adam's a smart boy. Indeed, he is. He gets it off me. Yes. Most guys wouldn't even think about all that sort of stuff. I wonder why. Because that's the way we've been created, I guess. Yes, but I want to be different from all men. In what way? An A-plus partner looks like me. I'm saying it because it's accurate, Mum. Yeah. Far-out, Mike. And... He's cute. ...when I do get married in the future, not only will my wife be my most crowning achievement, but also, I've actually envisioned a lot of family members in the future saying this... these words to my wife af... after my passing. What the hell? After your passing? ""Being your husband... nothing made that man any happier."" Mate... You're thinking too far ahead, mate. Dad, I always think ahead. Yeah, but that's a bit too far. Excuse me, everyone. I need to do my final preparations for the date. Okay. Thank you. So cute. Okay, which one? Ah-ha! Don't wanna be late! I know, I'm coming. Don't forget the rose. I won't forget that either, Mum. Okay. No problem. Don't forget your wallet. Nope. I never forget that, either. My... My hair comb. Um, just... Just bear with me for a couple of minutes. We'll be there, we'll be there! It's all right, Mike. Ready. Okay. Ready? Yep, ready. Good stuff. All right, well, all the best, Michael. Good luck. Thanks, Dad. Thank you. Take care, Dad. Good. Now get outta here. Yep, see ya, Dad. Nice flower, by the way, too. See ya. Remember your brother's advice. Got it! Got it. Ah, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Would you like some table water? Uh, yes please, thank... thank... Please and thank you. You all right? Just can't believe that this is happening. Little nervous."
Love On The Spectrum,01,02,"for years, ever since I left school. You all right? Little nervous. Just butterflies. She won't see it there. Hey! Hello, Amanda. How are you? Oh, please, allow me. Thank you. I'm... How have you been? I'm good. How are you? I'm very good as well. And, um... this is for you. Oh! I love flowers. You do? Yes. Thank you. It's my pleasure. You know, I used to study flowers. I never knew that. Yeah. Hmm. So, um, what's been happening? Been working. Yeah. Pretty sure. What have you been up to? Not a lot, just work as well. Yeah. Mmm. Okay. Mmm. Mmm. The last time we met, you said that you love cats, right? And you also said... Ah, thank you. It's all right. Thank you. And, so what other hobbies do you have? I've got birds I look after, and I like to do a thing called cosplay and go to conventions. Comic conventions? Yeah. I do too! Really? Yep. Yeah, have you been to one before? Yes, the Oz Comic-Con. I've been at that one. Have you been to any others? No, just that. Yeah? So, what else? Hmm. Might have to come back to that one... Uh... I wanted to ask you, when is your birthday again? I had it on Wednesday. Oh, I missed it. Yeah. When's yours? Twentieth of March. Same month as my cat's. Yeah. So, how many birds do you have? About 12... I think. I used to have more. Oh. So they flew away? Yep. Hmm. That must have been saddening. It's all right. You just learn from it. I suppose. Would you like to take a break? I'll be back, okay? Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Oops. Yeah. Is there anything we can do, Amanda, to help you feel better? I think it's too formal. I can't do this. It's just bad anxiety. Um, Cian? Cian? Hmm? Did I go too far? Too far? With... with the questions. No, I don't think so. Not at all. Oh. 'Cause... she seems a little bit quiet. Hmm. Um, here are your bag and your rose. Thank you. This doesn't have to be a date. Yeah. We can just, um... have a friendly dinner as friends? I think... wait, and I'll do another time. Yeah. Shall I s... see you to the... door? If you want to. Okay. Well, it was lovely seeing you again, Amanda. Mm-hmm. Sorry how things turned out. It's okay. I do feel bad. Don't feel bad. I just feel like I may have gone too far with the questions. Well, you take care of yourself, Amanda. You too. And good luck. Yeah. Oh, well. That's... That's life, I guess. Hi, I'm Maddi. I'm single, and I'm on the spectrum. I enjoy video games, books, and animals. How would you describe yourself, Maddi? I'm a very independent person. Reasonably smart. Uh, quirky. Always seem to, like, stand out a little bit without even trying. Or I'm funny without trying, people tell me, so... What's something you'd like people to know about you? That just because I'm on the spectrum, I'm not... I'm not... I'm not dumb. Some people can be really condescending, like, ""How... are... you?"" sort of thing. I'm like, please, come on. How do you know when you're in love? Um, I can't really say for sure, 'cause I've never really been in love, but I can only go by what... like, what I've seen in movies and things, so I'm not really... Can't get into that too well, sorry. Can you describe your ideal partner? Tall, muscular... rich. So, what do you guys think about me dating? I think it's great if you wanna date. Maybe you should date, get married, and move out of home. Move out of home being the important one. Ah... Well, how would you react if I brought a boy home? I think we'd cheer. I'd have to vet him. Make sure he was suitable for you. Make him very uncomfortable. Like we did with Montana, when she brought her boyfriend home. Right. What do you think? If I ever date, it'll be a couple of years before he meets you guys, at least. Years?! That's a bit rude. Protect the poor guy for a little while, for God's sake. Oh! Okay, well what about tonight? Let's talk about tonight. Who's going? So, superheroes disco tonight, down at Darling Harbour. And what are you going as tonight? Look for a Superman girl. Batgirl? Yes. Maybe we look for a Batman tonight. Okay, we're focusing a bit too much on tonight. Well, I think you gotta start somewhere, and maybe we start with tonight. What do you think are the qualities of a man that you'd like to date? Rich, muscular, tall. Eight-pack. Like your mother landed. Rich, muscular, tall. Mm-hmm. You need to lower your standards. You're not gonna get tall, muscular, eight-pack. You don't go to the gym. Where'd this eight-pack come from? It looks good. You don't go to the gym! I don't want someone flabby. Excuse you! You don't either. We were supposed to go to the gym today. I did go. There's no shame in being picky when it comes to love. What? Have I got this on backwards? Yep. These ones go down over your shoe. So, at the back, like... No, at the front, so turn it round. There should be an elastic thing... and socialize with her peers. Okay, pull it up. Yep. I would like to see her have somebody in her life. Clearly, I'm not gonna be here forever. It would give me some comfort to think that someone's there to look after her and she's there to look after somebody else. There we go. Wow, that looks cool. Where's the mask? Did you put it somewhere? No, I've got the mask here. Thank you. Do you ever worry that she will end up alone? Yeah, all the time. Mmm. All the time. That's good. Hello there. Ready to party. to bring people together You can't just dance with yourself, find people to dance with. Who do you know over here? This man here, you should be dancing with him. And he's tall... And a lot of money, he's Iron Man. If he's ugly, tell him to leave his helmet on. All right, I get... I get the point. I'll go talk to him. All right, guys. Whoa, hello. Would you like to dance? So, Sean, are you enjoying yourself tonight? Yes. Okay. How old are you, Sean? Twenty-eight. I'm 24. I'm 28. That's good. Tell me about yourself. What are some of your hobbies? Um... I'm trying to think. Hmm. Well, why... why don't I go first? My hobbies include video games... Yes. ...books, and animals. Yes. What about for you? What are some of your hobbies? Um, I'm trying to think. Do you like animals? Yes. Do you have any pets at home that live with you? Yes. Cat or a dog? I... I have a cat. Aww. I have a female cat named Marmalade. Is she a nice cat? Yes. Likes to play? Yes. Um... Should we head back inside, you think? Yes. Or would you like to stay out? Okay. Conga line! Conga line! Conga! Everybody in the conga line! Whoo! So, Kelvin... you just checking your hair? Looking good? Excellent. So, you're ready to start? I'm Kelvin. I'm 21. I have autism, a disability which helps me concentrate on one thing, rather than getting distracted by others. So, you think your autism helps you to really focus on one thing. How old were you when you were diagnosed with autism, Kelvin? Two years old. Wow, that's pretty young, hey. Do you think you're different to other people your age? Yes. How are you different? I have a different, uh, look in my face, and different personality from others. How would you describe yourself? I'm caring, smart, gentle, considerate, and professional. We'll share it, Dad. Yeah, maybe we can share. Yeah. This is so delicious. Mmm-mmm. Would you like to see Kelvin find a partner? Yes, definitely, yes. Being his father, yeah. Yeah, I'd really like to see if he can... uh, have... have a date, and then girlfriend, have a partner, and then, even better, to have a family. That's nice, isn't it? A bit hard, but, uh, hopefully, uh, there will be a day that, uh, this is possible. What's the hard part? What do you think will be difficult? I think it's the, like... uh, for him to communicate with somebody which is at the same wavelength. How did you feel when you heard that he was on the spectrum? Uh, devastating, but, uh, well, we have to come to terms, and we have to try our best, like, to help him. Yeah, that's what we did, like, all these years. Are you proud of him? Oh, definitely. I'm very proud of my son, yeah. Hopefully, one day, he will... He will find his partner.Yeah. Good to at least start with maybe a bit of practice. Hmm, yeah. Practicing what? Dad? Hmm? Practicing what? Uh, go out dating and seeing other, uh, people, and seeing ladies... Taking them out for dating, on dates? Yep, have dinner, go to the movies, yeah. Someone who is younger than you, Dad. Yes, of course, yes. For your dating, yes. What do you think love feels like? Love feels like when a man and woman get together, they'll make a perfect bond. Do you think it's harder for people with autism to find... a relationship, to find a partner? Some of them. Some girls don't feel like dating with someone in disa... with disabilities. What? What is it, Dad? It's me, Cian. Can we come in? Um, yes. This is a cute R2-D2 toy. Say hi, R2-D2. Beep-boop, beep-boop, beep-boop. And this is the poster of my year 12 formal. Did you take a date to the formal? I didn't. I want to show you the drawings that I made. This is Chibi Tsuyu. Eating frog cake. This is Suzuha Amane. She's strong-willed, athletic, like the one that I'm looking forward to dating. This is my original character, Yuko Ezo. She likes jellybeans, miso soup, mackerel, and carbonated drinks. So you made up that character? Yes. It's for my story. Where is your story? It's... Wow, that is incredible. You wrote all this? Yeah, I wrote it from my mind. I'll still keep on writing until I reach the end of this book. I think that'll take you a while. What...? Oh. T-That's enough. Excuse me. That's enough for now, okay? Enough filming? Yes. Thank you. We'll see you next time. Bye! Hello, Jodi. How are things? Things have been pretty good. Just work and that's about it. with somebody. About the date, it ended too early. My date got overwhelmed by the atmosphere. She had anxiety, and I was starting to get a bad vibe about things. I just told her that if she had to go, she was quite welcome to. That's really supportive. you were getting to know her? Yeah, I was. We both love cats. She loves comic conventions, and I do as well. I'm actually gonna be seeing her on Sunday. We'll be going to a comic convention together. with each other? Who knows? We might. you feel a little bit awkward Yeah. on the weekend. Yes, the Skipper off Gilligan's Island. Because... Because Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann on the show, will be there herself. She's pretty much the total package. She's not the hottest woman in the world, she's beautiful, but not extremely beautiful, but she's definitely polite, she's pure and very wholesome. That kind of woman is very hard to find. Which is unfortunate. Yes. Yeah. Yep. Will do. Likewise. Thank you for your time. All right, see ya. Take care of yourself. Would you say that you're different to other people? Well, yeah, 'cause I've got a disability, I'm on the spectrum, people are always gonna look at me as different from them, and I know I'm different from them, and that's fine, so... If we're all the same, the world would be pretty boring. Would you like to go out with a guy who is also on the spectrum? Yes. Some people like to choose partners who are the exact opposites of them. They've run out of things to talk about. How is that so? If you have lots in common, you wouldn't run out, it'd be endless conversations. So, I think... similar personality traits is quite good. for her very first date. Wow, you look great! Thank you, I know. You've got your special necklace on. Yes, it's a favorite. Your watch is even color-coded with your top, tonight. It's called ""successorizing."" Successoring? Success with accessories. Oh, I see. Oh, wow. Old people are so out of the loop, really. Excuse me! So, how are you feeling about tonight? Nervous. Your very first date. Yes. On Valentine's Day. I need a drink. You need a drink... You don't even drink! I don't care. Can I take a photo? No. No. Can I take a photo? No! Please, let me take a photo of you. No, come on. I don't need to be fussed... I'm not gonna fuss. Just one quick photo. Please. Do not put it on Facebook. No, I won't put it on Facebook. One... two... three. Okay. First date photo. Ooh! So excited! So excited! Please! Oh, God! No! God. Have a good night. I'm nervous. This is why I don't want you there. Okay. All right, all right. Leaving now. Have fun! That's important. Have fun. Bye! See ya. Right, that's it, huh? She's off. She's launched. Oh, my goodness. I wonder if all the coaching... I'm gonna be so nervous for her. Hello. Hi. Are you Maddi? Yes. I'm Mark. Nice to meet you. Mark, nice to meet you. Happy Valentine's Day. Thank you. I got these for you. Wow! Thank you. Great. And this... Thank you very much. They're lovely! Thank you very much. Right. Oh. It's nice to meet you. Lovely. Yeah. Okay. So, how's your day been so far? Oh, yeah, pretty good. Pretty good. Much better now that there's sweets. Oh, yes. I love sweets. Ah. How are you feeling? Uh... Not too bad, actually. Pretty... Pretty good. Slightly nervous. But what about you, how are you feeling? I feel good. Really confident and excited. That's good. Sorry to interrupt. Would you like to order food? For the main meal, I'll have the ravioli with ricotta and spinach. That would be nice. And I will take... the gnocchi, please. The gnocchi? Thank you. Okay. Thanks for that. Thank you. Enjoy your night. Thank you. We will, thank you. Okay. What is your favorite thing in the world? Dinosaurs. Oh, yeah? I'm into paleontology, stuff like that. Into what, sorry? Paleontology. How do you pronounce that? Pal... Paleontology. Paleontology. Sorry, I haven't heard of that one. That's okay. Paleontology. And that is? The study of prehistoric life. Oh! Yes. Cool, that's pretty cool. But I'm... Palen... Sorry. Palen... What is it? Pa-leon-to-lo-gy. Pa-leon... I'm sorry. No, it's all right, it's okay. Paleontology, okay. Yeah. How's yours? It was nice, it was really nice. I love ravi... ravioli. Mmm. You look beautiful. Very, very beautiful. Thank you, you look... you look quite nice your... yourself. Thank you. And that's a really beautiful necklace. You're very lucky to have that. It suits you well. Thank you. Thank you. I just wish this night didn't have to end. I can't remember when I've had this much fun. Yeah! It's been... certainly been... certainly been a very interesting evening, so... Well... Thank you. Thank you. Um... Maybe we should dine and dash, what do you reckon? Oh, no! No? You don't... don't like that idea? Subtotal... We could grab our stuff and run down the street. What... What... What did you order? The gnocchi. Shall we pay for ours separately or something? Uh... I've... I've got money, so, like... Would you like to split? How would you like it? Actually, um, I'll pay on this. Yeah. Rest on the card? Yes. Okay. Well, it's nice to meet you. It was nice to meet you, Mark. Thank you for... I hope we meet each other again. I had a great time, and I hope we can do this again. I had a good time too. It would be good to hang out... Yes. ...again, like... And I wish you all the best. Thank you. Thanks, once again. Thank you. See you. Have a wonderful night. Bye, Mark. Thank you very much for... You're welcome. ...the flowers. Thanks. You have a good night. You too. Bye. Bye-bye. See ya. How did the date go, Mark? Do you like Maddi? Oh, she's really nice and very sweet, and charming. I feel like she's the type of person that I'd love to spe... have spend my life with. Hi, sweetheart. Hey, Mum. How'd you go? Great. Did you have a lovely time? Oh, loved it. Lovely meal, and enjoyed the company? Oh, yes. Oh, she was spectacular. Beautiful? Oh, that's lovely, darling. She was a lovely woman. Yeah? That's awesome. Never had that much fun in one night. Can't remember the last time I ever felt this good. Oh, really? I'm so happy for you. So, how was tonight, Maddi? Yeah, it was a good night. I had fun. We had lots to talk about. He seems pretty smart, so, yeah. Yeah? Yeah, not many people interested in... paleontology. I think I've got that right. Hope that was right. Add the eight-pack, and that'll be perfection, so... Do you think you're a romantic person? I will be. How would you ask a girl on a date? If you liked someone, how would you ask them? Shall we go out for dinner together? Or should we have some... Shall we go out for a party... and dance to the music together? It'll be fun. has come to meet Kelvin Often when I meet people for the first time, I'm really checking to see what their ability is with initiating conversation. Sometimes I won't say hello to start with. I'll wait and see whether they can actually initiate verbally. Because sometimes people can't start a social interaction. Cool, it's you. Jodi? Hello. Hey there. Welcome. Thank you. Nice to meet you. My name's Kelvin. Nice to meet you, Kelvin. It's called the autism spectrum, because it's a spectrum. Come on, follow me. There is not two people on the spectrum where their autism presents in the same way. It is so diverse. And that's its beauty. It doesn't matter whether you're on the spectrum or not, everybody has a basic human right and a basic human need for connection and love. So... here's the girl. Why do you want to have this girlfriend? Because we... Because she's nice. What will you and the girlfriend do together? Together... we should go out on... a date. Yeah? What else do girlfriends and boyfriends do? Hug and kisses? Hugs and... yeah. Hugs and kisses. So, would you like to do hugs and kisses? Yes. Yes. When we go on our first date with somebody, what do we do on date number one? We should introduce her by name... first. What if the girl wants to sit down at the table? What would you... would be a good thing for you to do? Good thing... Like this, so you and I, I'm... I'm... I'm gonna come... Pretend Dad's not there, 'cause we don't want Dad on the date, do we? What? No way, Dad's not coming on the date. You show me what a gentleman would do if... if... Jodi's coming on... to meet you. Okay, you ready? Are you a gentleman? Hi. Here you go. Here's your seat. First of all, you have to introduce... Hi, my name's Kelvin Wong. Nice to meet you. My... My interests are manga and drawing and computer. Okay, first of all, you want Jodi to sit down, so we're on the same level. Don't we? Yes. Okay, so here's my chair here. Try again. Okay. Okay, you ready? Here I come... Hi, Jodi, my name is Kelvin Wong. Nice to meet you. Hello, Kelvin. My name's Jodi. Then the chair. Let her sit down. Uh... Here's your chair. No, go out and take the chair, and then... Go out and take... No. No, Kelvin. Stand up, get the chair out, and let the lady sit down. And then you say, here's your... Here's your chair, Jodi. Thank you very much. No, now you have to... That's a good... When... When the girl... She might already be sitting, but remember, before you move onto talking about yourself, we always do greetings first. Greeting. Greeting. Now, how... how are we going to start talking with the girl about... common interest? Common... Common inter... If you just start talking about... ""Hi, I'm really into computers, and I really like games and my iPad."" No! Okay. So the girls really like it... if people, boys, the first thing they do is ask them... A question. Perfect. Because then the girl thinks... ""Kelvin is really interested in me."" What would be a good first question that you could ask her? Ask her... What are your interests? Oh, nice one. What are your interests... Perfect! ...by the way. Perfect. So what about if she comes back and she says, ""I love animals and everything about animals."" Ooh. Cutie, indeed. And they are so cute like toys. They are like toys. What about... And then the girl might ask you a question... Do you like animals? I meant, I'm also interested in animals. We should go to the koala park. You're fine... Well, that was nice. Why were you suggesting that you go to the koala park? It's because she likes animals. I'm really proud. That is excellent. If she likes something that you don't like, is that okay? So, say she says, ""Oh, my favorite anime is... Yeah, uh, I used to... What if she goes, ""I like..."" I used to watch it, but not anymore. Not anymore. So is that okay that she likes different anime and manga than you? Yes, like, I get that Ouran High School is bad taste, and I shouldn't watch it, because of... 'cause it has mature themes. Okay. So, we started talking about anime. What did you do with your body? Uh... Looking away. You're looking away. And that's a no. Exactly. We've gotta keep the conversation being... Fifty-fifty. Fifty-fifty. So, if you turn away and start talking to yourself about your manga... It's not a good thing. It's not fifty-fifty, is it? I have to go to the bathroom. I'll be back. It's good that you come in and, like, show him all this. Like, it's very, very useful for him. Sometimes, like, man to man, it's difficult to get over to him. It's very hard. Do you know, I think this is stuff that... This is all the... the really simple things... Mmm. Um, that we forget are so important about social skills. Mmm-hmm, yes. But when you get to 21, almost 22, and he's desiring to have a relationship, it's very hard for a dad to do that. Yeah, yeah. Isn't it? I find it really hard for me to... Yeah. My job just is teaching people who are ready for... Um... ...dating and relationships. Yeah. And... Uh, for next one, I'll ask her what movie we're watching. Oh, have you been thinking about that? Oh, I... I was thinking. So, the most important thing about the first date is... Is the... Is, um... Greet her! Greet her. And what are you trying to find out? You're trying to find out... what you have in... What? In common. Perfect. You have to have some things that are the same... but you're allowed to have some things that are... Different. Perfect. I think your dating's gonna be good. Just remember, we go up the steps... slowly. Take it easy. Take it easy. I think for Kelvin, the challenge is just gonna be the beginning. Challenges of social skills with another person. He's at the really beginning journey of understanding what it is to be with another person and what that feels like, and has to go through all the things that we all go through. The rejection, finding out whether we've got a good match with somebody... At this stage in his learning, it's... it's about practicing. Just getting out there and giving it a go, and finding out who's a good match for him. Out you go, Jodi. I'll see you anytime. Okay, see you, Kelvin! See you! Hey, bud. Hey. How'd it go?! How'd it go?! Tell me all about it! Calm down. How did it go? Yeah, fine. He was a very nice guy. Really? What did he look like? Oh, you've got a photo? Yes, I do. Perfect! Oh, he's very nice. Yeah. Yeah... Are they the flowers that he brought you? Yeah. That was a nice touch, white roses. Yes, yes. What did you do when you got the roses? I said thank you and hugged him. You hugged him?! Yeah, like... Show me. Show me what you did. Just like that, sort of thing. Oh! I can do it properly standing up. Oh, that's a good thing. Don't make a fuss, honestly. No, everything was okay? All right, tell me all about him. What do you mean? Well, do you want to see him again? Yes. Perfect. I think he looks like he's good son-in-law material. Off you go, thanks. Off you go. Goodbye. Okay, all right. Parents, honestly... Jeez, Louise. Do you feel like you've got a lot of love to give? Yes. All the people I know and care about, they know me for my... for my large heart, which was once described as... ten sizes too large. Aha! There she is. Hello, Amanda. Hey! Good to see you again. Good to see you. What are you dressed up as? My character name's Riko. From what? An anime called Love Live! Ah. Yeah. Right. What's the book you've got? Oh, that's a cookbook. Is that part of your character? Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh. Actually, um... I wanted to see if I could get Dawn Wells to, um, autograph this. Okay. Is there anywhere you wanna go? Uh, yes. Um, you want to check out a few places? Okay. Do you know much about Dawn Wells? No... Barbara Eden? No. Barbara Feldon? No. Oh. Then you probably haven't seen No. Or Get Smart. No... Mmm-mmm. Ah. Oh, look, there's one with a costume right now! The genie? Yeah! Look! Look! I can see. That's her! Yep. That's the costume. If you ever wanted to have lunch or dinner somewhere, we don't have to... have to go somewhere formal. Okay. We can go somewhere casual. Yeah. Probably should've done that the first time. So, what do you wanna look at first? There is something I want to get. It's up this way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no. Everything okay? Don't you agree that that mask is creepy? Where? Right there, the guy with the dark hair. I refuse to watch those Halloween films. You don't like them? I hate 'em. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. They're too scary. A little bird tells me that you love plushes. I do. I've got lots of them. Yeah? Yep. I actually have a bit of an affinity for them myself. You like them too? I keep it secret, though. Oh.

I would be the kind of partner that is able to provide five things that every woman needs. Love, respect, happiness, support, and security. Oops. Uh-oh. Here's trouble. Oh, my goodness, who's that? Who's that? Hello? Hi, Mark, how are you? It's Maddi. Yeah, I'm doing pretty good. We've... I've recently adopted a new puppy. Yeah. He's a... He's a miniature schnauzer and his name is Arnold. Yeah. Ask him what he's been doing. Yes, a new best friend. Ask him... on a second date to Sydney next Friday? Next Friday. Yes, that would be... Yes, I would like... I would like to do another catch-up.

I'll see you later. You too. See you then. Bye! Wow! Okay. Such a pretty face. So, can't forget a pretty face! Whoo-hoo! Mmm! This is exactly why you guys are not coming. Maybe we should go and meet his parents. No! Make sure he comes from the right background. Right background. Sounds like it is. What? No. You're rushing things. No. Oh. Okay. How would you feel about having a partner and having love in your life? It would make me feel confident. I got pictures of girls in my brain, right now. They look cute. And they make me feel like I'm gonna love them. for a special night. Okay, you're all ready to go. Okay. Thanks, Dad. Just enjoy yourself tonight, huh? Just remember what Jodi said in the morning. Do a greeting with her. Yeah. And then introduce each other. Yeah. And then talk to each other about interests. That's right. Fifty-fifty. That's right. You don't need to say it. Just in your mind. Just remember it, yeah? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Looks like I'll be having fun tonight."
Love On The Spectrum,01,03,"What do you think love is? It can make people do crazy things that they wouldn't think of doing, make them act all bizarre. I think it requires, um, communication, honesty, and compromise. with his dinosaur knowledge. Hey, Maddi. Nice to see you again. Good to see you. Hey. How are you? Good, and you? Awesome.  Haven't been here in ages.  Well, you're gonna love it. Here we are, lo and behold, the dinosaur exhibit.  Ooh.  You know who these guys are? They're raptors. Raptors. You might remember them from movies like Jurassic Park or documentaries. Oh, I couldn't watch those movies. I tried to. It's just too much violence and gore. It's like, oh, my God.  Check out that toe claw.  Yeah, it's so long and sharp.  Yes. You could take someone's eye out. And it's very good for killing its prey with. How about that, eh? Yes.  This one's from Africa, Nigersaurus. That's a Hypsilophodon. It's a cute little dinosaur. Sure.   When they discovered the Sinornithosaurus, it sent shock waves throughout the paleontological community. This is Maiasaura. The name Maiasaura means ""good mother."" Well, there you go. Yeah. This is the femur of the sauropod dinosaurs. Some of them are so big, you can't even wrap your arms around them. Here's my old favorite, Stegosaurus.  Stegosaurus. Minmi. Minmi? Yeah. It's an Ankylosaurus. Here's a really cool dinosaur. Cryolophosaurus. Oh.  Interesting fact. Tyrannosaurus Rex has the strongest, the most powerful bite of any other dinosaur.  Yeah. Truly a formidable predator.  Is it going well so far? Oh, yeah. I've hardly been... I haven't been... I haven't been able to get much, um, sentences in, because he's always just, like, saying something. But that's okay, like... It's fine, so... Ah, perfect.  That was love. Ah, this is perfect. Yeah, fabulous.  Such a beautiful place.  Yeah. Nice.  Just feel that breeze. It's like Mother Nature is giving you a nice welcoming kiss. Hadn't thought about it like that.  One day, um, Ma... Um, Maddi, one day, if you found the perfect guy, would you like to get married? Um... Well... Maybe, I think... I think that's kind of a question... when... when I find that someone... Yeah. ...and kinda if. Do you feel anything about me? Um...  I know... Oh, jeez. Um... Yeah. Oh, look... I think you're a very nice guy, very smart, and very interesting. Yeah. And very good friend material. Yeah. I just... There's no romantic feelings, like... That happens a lot. But, uh, I think you're beautiful. You're smart as well. Oh, thank you. And you... you're very enthusiastic. I think you have excellent friend material. There's nothing wrong with being friends. Yeah, yeah. You know... At least I made a new friend. Yes, yes. That's the wonderful gift of life. Yeah.  Well... Okay. It's been a wonderful day. Yeah, it has been quite an experience. I wish you all the best. Thank you. I hope you take care of yourself. I wish you all the best for the future. You too. All right. You as well. Okay. Well, goodbye. Bye.  I've never had romantic feelings for anyone. And I'm not sure, like... if it hasn't happened by now, it might not happen, you know? So, like... Like, maybe it will happen if I meet the right person, but, like... And because I never experienced it, maybe I don't know how to read the signs, or... pick up the emotions, or whatever. Hey, Mark. Hey, Dad. Great, we had a wonderful time. Great? Well done. Good on ya, fella. So, what happened? Well, we... we're not really... compatible. Oh, okay. That's fine. We always said that might be the case. Yeah. Well, to be honest, I feel a little bit sad. Yeah, I understand. And so, you left on a good note, though? Yeah. A happy note? We're both friends, so... Right. That's all we can... That's all we can ask for. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Ready to go home? Yeah. It's been a long day. Yeah. Okey-doke, let's go. All right, shall we check this place out? Oh, it's amazing. in his search for love. for some dating advice.  Good thing this table's free. Yeah, this is the best one in the place. What's going on in your life at the moment? You've been searching for dates? Yeah. Maddi was a nice person. But... unfortunately, we didn't have any romantic spark between us. Oh, man. We were more keen to friends. That's me. Thank you. You're welcome. Cheers for that. That is interesting. Ah, yes, nothing like a nice cup of tea on a wonderful afternoon like this. That's true. And that banana smoothie looks really nice, I've got to admit.  So, what do you think girls like? Humor. Oh, yes, yes, yes. And I do think, to get a girl to like you, is to flatter them. Oh, yes, definitely. Because they have feelings just like we do. Would you prefer a girl who has the same interest in dinosaurs? That would be wonderful. Yeah.  It's a huge world. Anything is possible. I mean, I like dinosaurs too, but not an obsession. Well, I'm madly in love. I'm sure you are.  Yeah.  Mmm. Are you, uh, dating anyone? Not officially. Okay, right. Yeah. I'm still looking. Well, stay strong. You know, someone will come along and... will be right for you. Yes, my soul mate is out there, I just haven't found her yet. Yeah. It will happen. It will happen. It will happen. Yep. Are you on any dating sites, like Plenty of Fish or eharmony? Oh, yes, I've looked into dating sites. Even int... Yeah? Even international dating sites. International dating sites, interesting. I could picture myself with a, uh, Mexican girl on my right shoulder and a Russian girl on my left shoulder.   Yeah... I guess I'm the international lover kind of guy. Ah, okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that was great... Oh, sure. ...having time with you. Thanks. I had a wonderful time, and I hope we do this again. Oh, sure, my pleasure. You take care, Ryan. Pleasure, as always. Wish you all the best.  Thanks, you too. Have a good day. Good luck with your search.  I will. You too. Thanks.  See ya, Ryan.  See ya, Mark. Take care.  How do you feel about being on the autism spectrum? I have mixed emotions, you know. Even though I'm on the spectrum, I'm still capable of falling in love and being a compassionate and caring person.  And have you ever had a relationship? No.  So, falling in love is something you would like to do? Oh. For a long time, yes. It's always been on my mind, and it's just so hard to get. This is a skull of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, I'm very proud of it, you know. I basically worship it. This is by a paleo artist. This guy here is a grade A, bona fide dinosaur. It has a small sail on its back. In the mating season, you would want to show that off and say, ""Hey, baby, look at me. I'm the one you want to mate with.""  Can you describe for me your ideal partner? I like a girl who is very passionate, at the same time, a very... calm and caring nature.  What if she hates dinosaurs? No deal. Hey, Dad. Hey, Mark. How was work? It's been a busy day.  I bet. Hey, Mum. Yeah, I sure did. Good boy. I'm looking forward to Matt's wedding. Have we heard any more from Matt and Emma? I think in a few weeks, you'll be going on the bucks night. Yeah, that would be fun. Yeah.  Is your brother getting married? Mm-hmm. would you like to do that one day? Yeah. You can find the girl of your dreams. I think you'd make a great boyfriend. You're a beautiful person. Yeah. We're just amazed at how far he's come. It... I mean, it's been a hell of a long journey. Mark, in his young age, he had limited language, meltdowns, he was destructive. A lot of our friends who had children with autism, um, their marriages broke down, and, uh, ours was strained too. And so, I think I need people to know that you do need to work together, and you have to work hard, and I think that it's now paying dividends. Sorry.  because it has been a hard road, but we've seen light at the end of the tunnel. And we've seen Mark just come so far.  How would you describe your ideal girlfriend? Clever, intelligent, energetic, athletic, strong... brave, grateful. And she smells good.  She smells good. And perhaps has a... smell of orange juice, or... um... or... flowers.  That sounds good. Good to see you. I'm having Teppanyaki here for dinner with my date. All right, okay, just take a seat.  Nobody likes a dumb-dumb man. Don't be a dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb- dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb...  There she is. My name's Kelvin Wong. Hi, Kelvin. Nice to meet you. What's your name?  I'm Jessica. Nice to meet you. Here... Please sit down.  Thanks, man. Wait, that's...  Mmm, hmm. You smell good. Yeah, it does. Okay. All right. What are your interests? Oh, uh, I like video games and, uh, computer. I actually brought my Switch today, if you want to play Smash. Um... When? No, as in, while we wait for the server to come over. I hate waiting. You hate waiting? What, wait, um... I am... I am waiting patiently. Um, okay. Damn, this is... What about anime? Or manga? Oh, I don't really... read or watch much anime, but I do prefer video games. I'm just gonna switch this on for you. Oh, excuse me, any... you like movies? Oh, uh, I do like to go see movies from time to time. So... do you like animals? Oh, I... I like animals. Ooh. All right, just hold your controller sideways like this. All right. Thank you. And do you like cooking? Uh, no, I'm not a huge fan of cooking. Wait a minute... Ah... I know how to do... what? What? I lose.   Well...  Aw. Oh, you... I guess you're not very good at this game, huh? You can't really rejoin. Sorry about that. Sorry, it's a shame. Shame, it's... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I thought it'd be good to entertain ourselves. What? I thought it'd be good for us to entertain ourselves. What?  Hello. Hello, how are you?  Okay. All right. some prawn...  Ooh. ...fish, chicken... beef, and fried rice. All right! Yummy! So, now I cook the seafood first. Ooh, fish! Ooh. Cutting up prawn. I did read that you had to cut out the head from the prawn when you cook them. Didn't think you'd have to cut out the guts, too. Ooh.  Ooh! Ah, wow. You're so smart! All right, please try prawn first. Thank you.  I will burn myself. Yeah, what he said. Bon appétit. Yummy. Mmm. Not half bad.  Fire? Ready? One, two, three, go!  Oh! Hoo, Jesus Christ! It is a fire. Fire, yeah. Kelvin, you've been speaking a lot of Japanese. Yes, I've been speaking Japanese for three years. all right? Can you catch your bowl first? Two hands. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. One, two, three... Catch! Good, yes. Oh, I-I learned it from my teacher, Travis-san. Ah, nice! Every Wednesday or Friday. Yes. Two hands on the bowl. Good. Yes. Yes. All right, ready? Catch, all right? One, two, three... Catch! Good. All right. Yeah.  Thank you. How do you make eating with chopsticks so easy? I'm a Chinese boy. And I come from a Chinese family. Oh. But I was born here in Australia.  I hope you don't mind me making a mess. I'm just trying to get used to these. How do you make them work so well for you, Kelvin? What is it? What is it you're talking about? The chopsticks. The chopsticks, oh. Copy me. No, not like that. Oh, yeah. Use your thumb in front of the chopsticks, only the thumb.  Oh.  Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, thank you.  Oh... Um... You're welcome. So... Do you like koalas? I do like 'em. And one day, would you like to go to the koala park with me? I would like... I actually would like that. How about Taronga Zoo? Where, Taronga Zoo?  Mm-hmm. That's a... It's in Mosman.  Have you seen the ambulance out there? What are they doing? I don't know, but it can't be good. I just hope they aren't coming in here, though. Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom, please. Can I go to bathroom, please? I'll be right back. Oh, okay.  Thank you. Be back.  What do you think of Kelvin, Jess? He's actually pretty nice, if you ask me. But he often had issues trying to understand me, and vice versa. Maybe it's because I'm not good at rolling my... R's, I can't do it. Cian, uh, Jessica's a very nice girl to me. She likes video games, movies, and traveling. And... But she doesn't like anime.  That's not true. Or manga. I actually do like anime, I just like video games more.  Why don't you go join her again and we can talk later, okay?  Okay. Anything you like most, other than video games? Oh, I like using the computer. Using the ""competter""? Yeah. What? Using the ""competter""? ""Competter""? The computer? I'm sorry, I don't want to be racist or anything. What, what? As in, you know, you said ""competter."" What? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not trying to be mean or anything, but... Competter? I'm sorry, but I meant computer. You know, laptop? The laptop. PC? Like my daddy uses. At home. Oh, heads up. All right, ice cream. Oh, caramel. Enjoy. Damn, that is good ice cream. You like yours?  Mmm, I like this. It was great going out on our first date together. Yeah, but don't automatically think we're gonna start kissing right now. Oh, oh, fine. Like, you're a great guy and all, but... I'm not ready to fall in love yet. You don't think I'm a g... You don't think I'm a great guy? No, I don't think... I don't think... You're not a bad person or anything. You don't feel like loving me? You know what? You're actually a great person. I'd actually like to hang out with you more as a friend. Not in the romantic way, just in the... platonic way. Platonic? Yeah. So, can I... add you to my contacts? Okay. And what's your phone number?  I'll just show it to you. Oh, that's fine.  Just type this. So, it's been a great time going on a date together. Yes. Hopefully, I'll get to catch up with you sometime soon enough. Okay, see you! Bye, Kelvin! Bye, bye!  Like, he's a really nice guy. I bet he'll find someone who loves him for who he is. But he kind of sucks at video games. She doesn't like manga or anime so much, but she likes video gaming more than that. It's better to be friends than being an official girlfriend.  What does love mean for you, Maddi? Well... love should mean that you stand by the person you're in love with, through thick and thin, and you don't bail... just 'cause you're bored. And it means, like, supporting them, and not just... not just turning a blind eye to when they clearly need help, so...  When are you happiest? With family. Family is like, um, brownies. They're a really sweet bunch, but you can't avoid getting a few nuts. Right!  Are we ready to get ready for the date? Yes, let's go get ready. Here are the pants. Uh-huh. Good.  Here's the shirt. Remembering that that goes to the back. Yes. People on the spectrum, they don't read the social cues that we all read. They get a lot of their social cues off television. And it was very early on I realized that I had to be the one she was getting her social cues off. Hey. How's it going? Oh! Oh, come around. Show me, show me, show me, show me, show me. Oh, that's good. Okay, how you feeling about it all? A tad nervous, but...  Do you wanna go through a rehearsal? Yeah, good idea. Steve, you're the barman. What are you gonna do when you meet him? Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Maddi. Oh, hi, Mad... Maddi, you don't need to... What? That's very hard. You've got a weak handshake 'cause you're old. Okay. Lovely to meet you, Maddi. Can I get you a drink? A lemonade, please. Lemonade. A lemonade, too. Thank you, barman. Two lemonades. So, you look lovely. Oh, thank you, you look decent as well. You look decent?   It depends on what his outfit looks like. What do you do for a living? I'm a jewelry designer. Yes. That job must rock. That's a good one! That's a good one! Your table is ready. Thank you. Maddison, would you like to go to dinner? Yes. Sit there, I'll sit over here with Steve. So, the idea is to keep the conversation flowing. Do you have any siblings? Uh, I have two sisters and two brothers. What about you? Two brothers and two sisters. And I have six nephews and lots of nieces. So, that's a lot of nieces and nephews... Do you want children of your own? No, never. When you're answer is no, you leave nowhere for the person to go. Because what you're trying to do is keep the conversation going. Let's try again. Do you want children of your own? No, because I think they're a waste of time and money. Good lord.  I don't know. What is that smile? Am I not allowed to smile?  No, people like smiles. Just be yourself, gorgeous. Just relax. You're telling me to keep the conversation going, but telling me not to tell people what they wanna hear, so I don't know how to combine those two. You can. You can still be honest, and... and say, ""Look, I don't think I'm ready for children. I may never be ready for children."" It just leaves it open. ""I may never""? I don't want to, like, put any maybe in there, in case he, like... I give him false hope. I don't want to, like, not prepare for it, and it comes up and I don't know what to do, so... cover everything. The chances of something coming up that we haven't covered is pretty high. We're gonna need to sit here for ages, then. No, we're not.  Yes, we are. You can't send me out there without being prepared. It is meant to be fun. Yeah, it is. Okay. So exciting, huh? Yes.   Are you a romantic person, Mark? Yes. Absolutely. And I just want to share my life with someone very special, and just show her the person that I really am, and to show her that my disability is not an obstacle, that I'm capable of falling in love.  If you do find love, how do you think you'd know? I feel like my heart skips a beat. My smile begins to beam. I just feel... entranced. set up for people on the spectrum.  The social club is about people with disabilities coming together, making friends, and having fun, which is very important, not just to me, but to everyone else that has a disability. Hi Mark, you came. Gonna sign up and play? Okay, cool. Yeah. How about you, Christina? You good?  I'm all right. You ready to have some fun tonight, guys? Oh, yes. Oh... no, no, no! What do you... What do you think about the new girls here? Yeah, they're nice. They're nice. I might like to talk to them a bit more later on. You know, get to know them better. So, how's your night been so far? You enjoying yourself? Yeah! Yeah, it's cool. I haven't bowled in ages, but... Yeah. So, do you have any family? Um... Well, yes, I have family. It's just me and my mum at home. Okay, I have a brother and a sister, and I have a mum and dad at home right now. And, uh, my sister will be... expecting soon in May. Oh, wow. I... I don't really care if it's a boy or a girl... ...as long as we're getting a new little... little baby child. Well, that's certainly happening. Yes. Oh. Ready to go. Righto.  Good luck, Presley. Thank... Oh, thank you.  We'll... We'll see.  Yes! Um, Presley? Yes? What are your interests in? I'm keen to know, what do you like? Um, I like to draw. Oh, that's great. Yeah, I really enjoy that. I like drawing nature and, like, animals and stuff. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah. Very beautiful. What do you like to do? Play video games, watch movies, read books. Yeah. What movies are you into? Which ones are you into? Um...  Well...  Um, just... Uh, well... Just... Sorry, I'm... blanking out. Hang on, sorry. Excuse me for a second. That's okay. You all right?  Oh, God. Sorry. I just blanked out from nervousness. and just don't know what to say. Couldn't talk. Just... just... just be yourself, man. Just... just... And just... ask your questions, you know? Just build on those conversations. Right. Just breathe.  Come on. Hi, are you Severin? Hey. Yeah. Maddi, nice to meet you. You're Maddi. Yep. Well, you know, how was your day, I guess. Oh, yeah, pretty good. Pretty good, just catching up on... chores, errands, bits and pieces, so... Yeah. And your... how was your day? Um... Let's see... Well, um... had an appointment earlier, and... other than that, um... sprucing up a bit.  Ah. 'Cause, um... Well, yeah. Uh, so... Yeah... So, um... What do you like to do for fun? Oh. Uh, I... I love video games. I'm a huge video game nerd, so...  Nice, same. What kind of games do you play? I play The Sims 4. That's a great game. Yep. I'm the ruler.  Nice.  Yeah. Um... So... Yeah, um... Um...  Yeah. Um... So, um... Goodness me, listen to that noise. Wow. Screaming kids, that is horrible noise. It's like, be quiet. Um...  Thank God it stopped. Like, do you think you'd ever want kids one day? Like... Oh, it's... It's funny for me. Like, if you asked me maybe a year ago, I'd be like, ""No, I never want children, ever! Ever, ever!"" Like, that's what I was like, but I think as I've gotten older, like, I... Changed your mind a bit? Like, I've become more open to the idea. I don't really know if I'd ever want kids. I... I'm open to the idea, like, eventually if I was to find, like, the right person... Hmm, but yeah. Yeah, being open-minded, so... Yeah. Crumbs, I was afraid this would happen. It's starting to fall apart. Oh, whoa.  Oh.  Yeah. Ah... Oh.  Oh, yeah. Yeah?  Yeah. All good?  No worries. How was everything? Delicious, thank you.  Yeah, pretty good. Great. All good. Um... May I ask, what do you potentially think you want to do as a career one day? I think something with... something with animals. I did an animal studies course at TAFE.  Okay. Now I'm doing Cert III Music Industry at TAFE. The piano... Oh. ...specifically. Nice.  Um... Absolutely love piano with great burning passion, so... When I was in high school, and I heard a guy playing, I... I think it was actually the Skyrim theme on piano, Oh, wow. That's what sparked a bit of interest. And then I started, like, self-teaching myself. Wow. And um... yeah. I do have a surprise for you. Oh.  'Cause, did you know, there's a piano they have right here. Oh, my goodness. I didn't notice that on the way in, no.  Yeah. You like Skyrim, right? Yeah... Oh, I recognize that. Wow, like...  A bit improvisation, a bit... actual Skyrim.  Uh... Seriously, you are really good at that. Yeah. Did you have lessons when you were younger, or like...? No, I've... All self-taught? I've self... Well, pretty much, yeah. I've self-taught since I was 18. That's very impressive for self-taught then. Oh, man. Y-You all right?  Yeah. Uh, um...  So, yeah... Is it the first date where you said they played Skyrim for you on the piano? Yeah, it's the first time anyone's done that for me. So, thank you very much. Very accurate. But yeah, um...  All right. Well... Well, I had a good evening, Severin. Thank you for coming out here and doing this. Nice to get to know you. Yeah, nice to get to know you, too. Um... Yeah. So, uh, you know... Do, like... Uh... Do you want to do this again sometime or... Yeah, it's a good... It's a good idea. We should... We should do this again. Fair enough, um... Okay, um... Yeah, I'll call you then. All right. It was nice meeting you. Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming out, and... Yep.  That's everything, so... Bye. Have a great night. You too, bye.  Yep. See ya, have a great one. She seems fairly geeky as well, which is, you know, my type. You know, I like someone who's a bit nerdy, like me. I think there may be potential there for something great.  Hey, Maddi. Hey, how are you guys?  Good! How was your date? Oh, yeah, really good. He was very... Severin was a very interesting guy.  Yeah? Cool! He played piano for... for me at the... at the restaurant. At the pub, so...   Oh, my Lord! Was he very good? Oh, he is really good. You know that game I play, Skyrim?  Yeah. He played me a music track on there which I recognize. I was like, ""Wow, how accurate!""  Oh, wow, so you obviously had Suppose so.  Excellent. That sounds like Yeah.  Okay, all right. Well, then, uh, Bye, guys. See you later. Bye.  They sound happy. Yeah. They always insist on being part of my life, so...  As parents do, I suppose. Yeah.  What do you think's the biggest challenge you've had to overcome? Um...  Trying to work on my social skills, and... trying to... you know... see how the real world works, and stuff like that. It's been a huge challenge. Can't wait for today's activities. It's a good opportunity, too, darling. Oh, yes. in his search for love. Have a great day. Well, you too. Hope you learn a lot... I will. And get a lot out of today. See ya, Dad. See ya, mate. for people on the autism spectrum, One of the biggest misconceptions that I've found about people on the spectrum is that they're perfectly happy not being social, not dating, and that just really is very rarely true. You guys excited for today?  For years, my phone has just been ringing off the hook from adults and their family members, um, desperate to learn how to develop romantic relationships. So that's where we come in with our dating boot camps, is to try to teach the skills that many people sort of take for granted and use naturally in dating situations. Dating is a choice, right? Do we get to date everybody? No. No. Does everyone get to date us? No. What could be the problem with choosing someone who's maybe not so nice? They could be doing drugs or alcohol.  Yeah. They could be part of a gang or...  Yeah. Would that be a good choice in someone to date? No. So we're all clear, there's good choices and bad choices when it comes to dating, right? When we're on a date, we have to be able to make conversation with people. Remember, we're supposed to trade information. Well, there's lots of rules about trading information. So one of the things you do is you're gonna ask questions, right? Because what is the goal, what are you trying to find? Exactly. And so, in order to find common interests, you have to share things about yourself as well. Yes.  Okay, we're gonna see a few role-plays about what not to do. So I want you guys to watch this role-play, and I want you to notice what Nathan is doing wrong in trying to trade information. -So, Lizzie, what'd you do on the weekend? I just went to the beach. Oh, cool, which beach? Uh, Bronte. Oh, did you go with your friends? Yeah, a couple friends. Did you go swimming or surfing? Uh, swimming. Oh, do you build sandcastles?  Do you play beach volleyball?  All right, timeout. So what did Nathan do wrong, Joseph? Um, ask too many questions. He was being an interviewer, right? It's not a reciprocal conversation, so they're not finding common interests. It has to go back and forth. Okay, watch this next role-play. Think about what Nathan is doing wrong this time. So, Lizzie, who was the last person you dated?  Uh... Jason. Did you love him?  Uh... Yeah.  What about me? Do you love me? Uh, sorry. Could we order dinner first? When are we gonna go on our honeymoon?  I'm just not... Sorry.  When should we get married?  Okay, timeout. So what did Nathan do wrong? A little bit too personal. He was getting too personal. Yeah, what else? Mark? It was like this. He put the hammer down too soon, you know? Got right into it way too quickly. Yeah, right, kinda came on way too strong. Joseph? Was being a bit too imposing and getting down her throat a bit. Yeah, exactly. All right, guys. Well, now that we know how to trade information and hopefully make conversations during dates, we're gonna practice this. So, who wants to go first? Okay, Mark, wonderful. Come on up to the front of the room here with Lizzie. We're gonna imagine that you're on a date with Lizzie, and you're just making conversation.  Yeah. And what will your goal be in this conversation? To find common interests.  Very good. All right. So, what do you like to get up to on weekends? I kinda like playing tennis and things like that. Oh, yes. Swimming, yeah... Well, my mum plays tennis. Oh cool, nice. She used to be in the... the league, but... She doesn't anymore. You know, so she just does it in her spare time. Yeah. That sounds fun. Have you tried it? I have, but I'm a little bit sloppy at it. Keep missing it, it's just... I just... Um, just... Um, just trying to think... Sorry, I'm... Oh. So, don't worry about that. You're doing a fantastic job. But think about questions that you might ask the other person... Oh, yes. ...to sort of get out their interests. And then you're doing a good job of sharing about yourself, but always making sure you're also checking in with Lizzie. Question, do you ever find it difficult to sort of come up with new topics to talk about? Yes.  Yeah. Does... Does that happen to other people too?  Yeah. So, you know what? This is a great opportunity for all of us as a group to maybe brainstorm what are some common topics that people talk about on dates? Family, exactly. What else? Holidays?  Holidays!  A lot of people think that social skills are abstract, but in reality, we're all naturally following concrete rules and steps, and so it's really critical that we outline what these steps are for our young adults. What else do you like to do? Go hiking, or to the beach, or see my friends... What about you? Well... to go hiking as well. I love to get out in nature.  You do? Yeah, it's so much fun. It makes me feel peace whenever I'm in nature. Wouldn't you agree? Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree. Yeah. I got lost last time I went. Oh. Well, I know my way around the forest. Oh, that's good, yeah.  It's a very good skill to have. Yeah. Yeah. I think Mark did a great job. What do you guys think? I think he did awesome. Shall we give him a round of applause? Yes. Thank you.  That was fantastic.  Well done, Mark. Thank you, thanks. Thank you. Okay, well, it's just been such a pleasure working with all of you. I'm so, so, proud of all of the... the progress I just saw in one day. I just want to wish you all the best of luck in dating. You know, dating can be hard, for anybody. But now you guys have all the tools that you need, and it'll be a whole new experience for you moving forward. I wish you guys the very, very best of luck, and a big round of applause to all of you. Congratulations... ...on completing our boot camp. Can you feel those? Do you think they look cold enough? Perfect, yeah. for a date at the zoo.  What are your hopes for today? I hope we enjoy each other's company and we have a good time. Yeah. Just be your adorable, beautiful self. And... pay attention to what she's interested in. Tell here about yourself. I will. Sometimes girls like to talk about themselves, too... Yeah. ...a little bit. I know. I know. I've got one tip for you, Mark. You know how you've been going to the gym? You want her to see your muscles, so this is how you do it, just like... You go like this, and you go, ""Do you see the pelicans over there?"" And let her see it, okay? What do you think of that? She'll be impressed. What do you think of that tip? I know, I know. Just let me handle it my way. Yeah, thanks, Dad. Yes. Yeah, thanks.... Thanks. So happy for him. Ah, it'll be great, won't it? Bye, sweet."
Love On The Spectrum,01,04,"I'm just... I'm just worried because I can't see your face. I think that glass on the angle... yeah.  How is it? Better? Uh, no, I think you made it a bit worse. I think... Whoo, I... Yeah, that's perfect.  Yeah? Yep. My name is Andrew. I'm 27 years old. I work at Family and Community Services in Newcastle. And I want to find a girlfriend for some love.  How would you describe yourself? Polite, on time, uh, cute... organized, as well... f-f-f-funny.  How are you funny? Uh... Like, sometimes I tend to, um... make some f-funny jokes, or different voices, as well.  What sort of voices do you do? Let me think, um... My name is Bond. James Bond.  Which Bond was that? Uh, I think that was Sean Connery. But, yeah, I'm still getting, like, used to it. Like, with the voice, making it a bit deeper and that.  How important would you say it is to you to find someone special? I think, to me, it will be very important to find someone, uh, for love.  What would you rate it, on a scale of one to ten, how important? I think ten, actually.  So, this is actually my bedroom. This is my number one bear, Angus. Most of the time, he normally sits with me. So, this is Ernie. He's been my second favorite bear. I actually got him when I was about six or seven years old, from Santa. And, um also, the Crocodile Dundee hat, actually. That's not a knife... this is a knife. So, this is my hobby room. It'll give you a bit more idea who I am and that, so... A set of a jigsaw puzzles here. Most of these old ships here are very, uh, collective and, uh, fragile. Here is a collection of my, uh, K'NEX. So, this is a six-foot clock tower which I built. It moves, as well. So, this is a six-foot, uh, Ferris wheel that I'm building at the moment, which is, um, nearly complete.  Do you think being on the autism spectrum kind of has something to do with you having these kind of strong interests in things? I think so, yes.  Sounds like you like to follow the rules. Yes. Yeah, rules and procedures, I'm very strict on those.  Get yourself plenty of ice. That much will be fine. My favorite drink is a Sex on the Beach.  And that's a cocktail? Yes.  Thirty mils of the peach schnapps, then 30 mils of, um, the vodka, Just stop for a second. I've made this wrong. It was supposed to go in this first.  Oh, no!  Try again. Thirty mils of the peach schnapps, in there... there we go. You will need 90 mils orange juice. Shake it without the ice for about ten seconds... And that's how you make a Sex on the Beach. Ahh. Perfection.  Have you ever kissed anyone, Mark? Like, a girl? No. Never.  Something you would like to do? Oh, yes. I mean, that would... be quite an experience. A very huge experience for me. I can't wait to see what she's like. Yeah, I really am excited and feel really good. Hello. Nice to meet you, I'm Mark. Hi, I'm Lauren. Nice to meet you, Lauren. Hi! Sorry. I wanted to wave, but, like, with my crutches... Oh, no, that's... that's... that's perfectly all right. That's... That's nothing to worry about. Yeah. How are you? I'm good, thanks. How are you? Looking... I'm... great. I'm really excited to this. Yeah, it's so cool.  So... So... Shall we go in? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Just take your time. Yeah, thanks. You know, don't want to rush you.  No. It's all right. So have you visited any places on Earth? I've only had, like, one major... um, overseas holiday. That was last year. Yeah. So, um, my aunt, who lives in China... Oh, okay. Yeah, she was getting married over there.  I've always wanted to go to China. Let me tell you a bit about myself.  Yeah. My favorite animals of all time are dinosaurs. When I saw Jurassic Park, it changed my life, and...  Oh really? Yeah. Okay, that's interesting. I read all sorts of books on dinosaurs... Yeah? ...and paleontology, and it... Okay, cool. And I even... Like Ross, in Friends.  I also love birds, since birds are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. That's true, yeah. Oh, that's so cute. Aww. It's very sad there's not many left of them.  Yeah, and sadly, some of them have been hunted into extinction by poachers.  Hmm.  During the Ice Age, the mammoths and the mastodons were hunted for their meat. Oh, yeah. You know? You would think that we would have learned our lessons, but... Yeah. ...the tragedy is, we're still doing... horrible stuff to these beautiful, intelligent animals that have the right to live peacefully on our planet. I don't know if you've heard, but they have good memories. Ah, yes! Yes, that's right.  Yeah. I think... I have no short-term memory. I have to see people quite a few times before I remember them.  Oh, okay. Right. So... I'm thinking I should hire an elephant, I'll teach it to talk... Yeah.  ...and then, it can just follow me around, and it can be my personal memory keeper.  This is the cassowaries.  They're such pretty animals.  Yeah, they're very beautiful, but they have a really nasty attitude. They've actually killed people. I mean, you see that? Really? Those feet look like very useful for disemboweling its victims. Put it this way, they're the closest as we can get to a raptor dinosaur. Oh.  Oh, that's a weird noise. That's not a good noise. Is it gonna start charging? I think it's best just to leave them. Yeah, we'll move on. See you, guys. See ya. Oh, she's a very wonderful, charming girl. She loves animals, and... really, I'm impressed by her enthusiasm and her admiration and respect.  Do you think there's any romance in the air? That's a bit up in the air at the moment. I can't say for sure. But, you know, we'll just have to wait to see if that spark can be ignited.  Would you like for that spark to be ignited? Yes. Yes. I've arranged to see a penguin-feeding show. Oh, awesome! Oh, thank you. I thought you would love to... That's very cool. Yeah. I do love penguins. So, you want to go and check it out? Yeah, that'd be great! Because I have cerebral palsy... Yeah. ...my favorite thing about penguins is that they walk funny. Okay. And I just love the fact that there's an animal that walks like I walk.  These are the little penguins. You have the opportunity to feed them if you want.  Absolutely! Which one of you lucky guys is gonna get the fish? Here you go. Aw, you look so cute! Waddle, waddle, waddle. They walk like me! Is it true that penguins will choose a partner and then stick with them for life?  Is that actually true? Exactly. And they sometimes will select the nest as to how well the male has actually built the nest. Oh. Oh, yes. So if you're keeping a nice house, then you'll bring the girls in. We took a ferry to Manly, once upon a time here. Oh, yeah? Nice. Yes. Yeah. It was beautiful, you know. Yeah, the Manly ferry's lovely. Oh, definitely, and... Yeah. We should do a Manly ferry trip one time. That would be great. Would be nice.  I've always wanted to go back on the ferry again.  Yeah, so we should, um... do that one time, maybe. Oh, I look forward to that. Yeah.  Sounded to me like you might have asked Mark out on a second date. Um... I... I may have, yeah.  I... I just... He was really nice, and I thought... it'd be cool to catch up again. Yeah. Well, thank you for that. No, thank you. It was wonderful. I hope we meet each other again. Yeah, definitely, we'll have to catch up. Oh, yes. Yeah. Thank you. For sure. That was great. You take care of yourself, and... Thank you. Yes. Um... Could I, um, maybe give you a hug? Is that all right? Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Oh.  I had... I like your shirt. Thank you. I had a great time with you, and... Yeah, it was great. You know, I hope we look forward to this again. Yeah, we'll definitely catch up. Bye!  Bye-bye!  It sounded like she asked you on a second date on the gondola. Yes.Absolutely. Absolutely.  That's pretty exciting. Yes. So, I look forward to that, very soon. Great. Can't wait. I'm so nervous.  Why? Because I've never done this before. Hi, my name's Olivia, uh... I'm 25, and, um... I have, uh, ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder. And I am... single.  How long have you been single for? Uh... What's today? Uh... My whole life.  What would it mean for you to find love? Amazing, I guess. I don't know. I never thought about it. 'Cause I didn't think it was ever going to happen, so...  Why don't you think it'll happen? Ninety-five percent of all people with autism don't find someone, so... probably just end up being another statistic, I guess.  Where did you get that figure from? I don't know. It could be incorrect. I found it online somewhere.  Why do you think so many people on the spectrum don't find love? I guess because of our social difficulties, I suppose. Oops.   Do you ever look at online dating? No. I've been too scared.  Why is it scary? Because on the internet, you can be anyone, and you don't know that... who they are. I'll show you. As the meme says, ""On the internet, no one knows you're a cat.""  I love cats. This is a Christmas present to myself. Her name is Duchess. I call all my cats ""Duchess."" I'm not sure why. It's supposed to walk, but this carpet's here, so it's stuck.  Is that cat's name Duchess?  It doesn't have one.  Why not? Because I hate that cat.  What's it like, being a girl on the spectrum? Extremely difficult, considering that there's no girl criteria. It's only boy. So you get... you get assessed on how male you are. This has been out all week, I should fold it. until well into adulthood.  What's important to you in life? Acting. Uh, performing. That... that is my life. That's who I am. It's my identity. I go to Options Theater Company. It's a, uh, theater company for people with disabilities. It's my home. It's my family. Without them, I don't know where... I don't know, uh, where I'd be. It... it changed my life.  Morning, Stuart. Morning, Olivia. Have you got a script? Ah, no, because I didn't realize I was gonna be doing my monologue today, on a Monday. You'll be all right. I had a hard life, growing up. So, Olivia playing Oberon.  When I came here, I felt safe for the first time in my life. I was finally with people who understood me. Where is my puck? Over the shoulder. And who get that I was different to other people, and treated me right. The trick that's coming in now is that you're setting the theme up for Midsummer Night's Dream. And that's why you're giving her the flower. The course of true love never did run smooth. Of course it doesn't.  Oh, got some feelings about that? Have you been in love before?  I have. Have you? Did it break your heart? Yes.   Yes. Yeah, but you know the feeling, right?  Yeah. And that's why... That's why Oberon is so powerful, so mischievous. He's scorned. That's why he's doing this. Hell hath no fury like a fairy king scorned. Hell hath no fury like a fairy...  Maybe that should be on the poster.  You're jumping around a bit, Olivia. Yeah, it's called disability. I jump around like a ping-pong ball when I'm happy or excited, or anxious, or nervous, or stressed. Um, those the only main triggers I know of.   At one point, we thought it was Tourette's. Another time, we thought it was chronic motor tic disorder. Many different theories, but no cigar.  And how long has that been around for? From the moment I was aware of it. I was born with it.  What does it feel like? It's a massive build-up with a pleasant release.  So, have you ever been in love? No.  Have you been in a relationship? No.  Have you been on a date? No. Yeah, so, at the moment, with my dating history, I think it's, uh, pretty poor at the moment.  So, there is no dating history. Yes. from their overseas holiday.  You like things to be clean? Oh, yes. Yeah, they'll be home soon. Just waiting for them to come down the street, actually.  Hi! -Hello, sweetheart. How are you?  Good. We missed you so much! I missed you too. Ooh, I just lost my sunglasses! That's okay. Never mind. job keeping the house nice and tidy.  Very good. And here's something that we thought you'd appreciate, Andrew, and all that. Oh, thank you. So, I'll put that with my other, um, collection of boats, and that.  So, Andrew's obviously keen to find someone special. What are your thoughts on that? Oh, we would love him to find someone, because I know how keen he is himself to get a girlfriend, and... and hopefully, one day, a wife. Because Andrew loves going out. He loves going out for dinner, and he loves going to the movies. Yep. He just doesn't want to do it with his mum and dad anymore. Oh, I still do, but because you're retired... ...you need your quiet time now. to spend your life with your mum and dad. No. We've always told Andrew, don't let anybody ever tell you that you can't do something. Andrew would always have a crack and have a go at something. Very proud of him. Very proud of him. I'd say he's a good boy, but he's no longer a boy. No, I'm a man now. That's right. A good young man. He's got the job and he's got the license. So, now he needs the girlfriend.  That's it. Andrew's ideal girl would be a girl that loves jigsaw puzzles and K'NEX. That would be... that would make it for him for the rest of his life. I just hope he finds someone that he's happy with. That's all we ever want for Andrew, is to be happy. He hasn't said it for a while, but I have heard Andrew say in the past, ""I wish I was normal.""  That must hurt a bit. Yeah, it does. How does it make you feel when you hear that?  Are you a romantic person? Yes, I'm a hopeless romantic.  Yeah?  Hmm. I love love. I love love songs, I love rom-coms. Half my songs on my iPod are roma... Are, uh, love songs and break-up songs.  Have you ever experienced unrequited love? When have I not?  I'm usually the, uh, crusher, not the crushee.  My feelings are never returned, normally.  So you've had crushes? Many.  And what... And what happens? I get very heartbroken.  Because all the guys always... Always want to hang out with me. They never want to hold my hand or date me.  How do you think it'll go today? Awful.   What are your concerns? What are you worried about? That I have a brain freeze and I don't know what to say. Or that it doesn't go well and I'm not very interesting.  It sounds like your worries are mainly about yourself... and not about whether you like the other person. Aren't they always?  Not always. Some people are very confident in themselves. I'm not confident in myself. This is a bit embarrassing. Hasn't turned up yet. I don't wanna be stood up.  There he is.  Oh, right. of slurping spaghetti...  Olivia, right? Yeah. Pleasure to meet you, I'm Christopher. You have an accent. Yeah... I know, I know. Everyone immediately thinks I'm American as soon as they meet me. Uh, do you want to get something? Yeah. Uh, hey, can I get a regular latte, if you got one? And, uh, anything you want? The easy street burger combo. Okay, uh, in that case, uh, no latte. I'll go straight for a, uh, easy street beef burger and cheese. This actually worked out better, 'cause when I first got here, it was full. Now there's no one around. I'm... Again, I'm so sorry that I waited so long. I mean, that you waited...  All right, let me start again. I know that feeling. No filter.  Ah. Ironically though, it takes me to forever to get all the thoughts out of my mouth. I mean, sometimes I immediately think that I need to, like, go on a script as soon as I meet someone. Then as soon as everything happens, I just feel like a wall just suddenly slams in there, then I can't even start to think until the whole thing's over and done with. Sorry, did I speak too fast? No, I just... I zoned out. That's all. I have this problem. Um, I know exactly the feeling. It takes me forever to try and, uh... Concentrate. Yes.  Focus. Uh-huh. Eh, trial and error. Don't you worry, I'm a bundle of nerves. Cheers to a bundle of nerves, then. And the birds.  You okay? Um... Yeah, just got a phobia of big dogs, that's all. I used to be a dog groomer. And trust me, that one's harmless. Oh, no, I'm not scared of dogs, just I'm scared of big dogs that jump. Oh.  Truth be told, I got pushed into dog grooming because of what my mother wanted me to do. I was more an actor and a writer than anything else. I'm an actor. I perform with a theater company called Options Theater Company. I would ask for, uh, contact details, but it's a bit too far for me. It's okay, you would not be allowed in anyway. It's a... It's a disability theater company. Don't know whether to take that as an insult or not. What is your disability? 'Cause I'm not seeing one. No offense. What does autism look like to you? Point taken. You should take your foot out of your mouth, sir. Thank you. I didn't know I had a foot in my mouth. Thank you very much. It is, when you say you can't see a disability, because not all disabilities are visible. And just like that, I just got proved how blind I am.  I normally don't disclose my autism straight away to people I meet. I really don't know how to properly describe myself, other than just Asperger's syndrome. That is autism. I don't know, some people say it's dyslexic, other people say autism. At this point, I just want to say, I'm a madman. Let's just go with that. My diagnosis is Asperger's. Hmm.  But because Asperger's, the term doesn't exist anymore, we're all Autism Spectrum Disorder. You okay? I choke on everything.  I'm not even sure why, I just do.  I like him. He's a really nice guy. A bit awkward, but I think we're both like that, so...  I think you just have to take... you'd have to take some time to build up the relationship.  I just like the peace and quiet around here. No, actually, that came in the right, the exact... That actually came at the right moment. You're welcome. Do you want me to start, or...? Um... Sure. I had fun. And every word that I said to you, and every word that I listened, all of it was true. You're a marvelous woman. Oh, thank you. I've never actually been told that before. I could feel that you were very genuine, yes. But I don't see this going any further.  Mmm. Not... Not really either, yeah.  Mmm. Not because of you or your faults. No, seriously, look at me. I can't, the sun's in my eyes. Hang on. How-how's that? How's... How's that? Yeah.  Okay, there we go. Nothing that you did has put me off. It's just that whenever I try and look for someone, I need to find a... spark. Okay. Anything...  Ah. Sorry... My jaw just clicked. Ah. Oh. I actually thought you were about to cry. No! My jaw clicked. It's all right. Ah. Well, I definitely want us to meet again. So, uh... Do you want me to, or...? Uh... Whatever you're comfortable with. Handshake, or...? Uh... Yeah, handshake. Okay. I'm a huggy person, but I don't know you that well, so... Fair enough, fair enough. Ah. All right. Well, thank you very much. You too. Look after yourself. I will. by a local disability organization. Good luck, darling.  See ya. See you later.  Bye. Hey, how you doing? Hi. Milly. Milly, Andrew. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Andrew. I'm just gonna get you to sign in real quick. Yes, excellent. I have had quite a lot of people ask me for this event, because people with these kinds of differences or disabilities find it really hard finding other people. And so, we want everybody to have the opportunity to fit in. Thank you all so much for coming this evening. I know it's terrifying and you're probably a bit nervous. So, if you need any help, feel free to just stick your hand up or start screaming. Whatever you want to do, that's fine. There are a couple of things on the table to help out. So these are questions if you're having trouble and want something to prompt. The other thing there is there are different questions on each of the numbers. So you can use the number cards, or you can use these if you want. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. We're not here to judge, we're just here to make friends.  Feeling a bit nervous, actually. Yeah, just I don't want to make a fool of myself, don't want to embarrass myself. Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm Casey. Casey? Nice to meet you. Hi, yeah. Nice to meet you. Yep. So, um, have you got a job at the moment, Casey? Yes, I work at a... like, the canteen café at the Newcastle University. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Are you still, um, living with your parents or are you by yourself? Yeah. I am. Yeah. I still live with my parents... Okay. ...but I will be moving out with my friend soon. Oh, okay, yeah. I'm still living with my parents at the moment, but... Yeah.  Hmm. Ah, pretty good. Um... Any good questions?  No... I'm trying to, yeah, find some good questions. Um...  Have you got a favorite movie? Favorite movie. Um... Movies done by M. Night Shyamalan. Oh, yes. Um... Yeah, I'm not really, uh, fussed on those, actually. No? No. What movies do you like? Probably, um, James Bond, um, maybe some of the old, children's, um, movies, like Toy Story, Oh, yeah. Gosh. Those ones obviously everyone would like, wouldn't they? Ah, very good. Well, it's, um, nice meeting you. Yeah, it was nice meeting you, too. Yep. Hi. Hi. I'm Andrew. I'm Evie. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice... Yeah. Uh... So, tell me about yourself. I like to bake cakes, Yep. I like watching anime... Yep. ...and I just am obsessed with animals. Okay. Have you got a favorite animal? Uh, wolves. I wanted to work with wolves in Canada. Okay. What about you? What do you do? Um, family, I work actually. I work for, uh, Family and Community Services. Oh. So, it's a, um... Yeah, a bit of data entry, uh, stock control, like, the stationery ordering and that, yeah. Um, I need those cards, actually. Sorry, I'm not really good at talking. No, no, no, it's okay. I figure we've done all the good ones, so, um... Yep. Uh, let's see. Um... Ah, no... If your life was a movie, which celebrity would you play? Ah, Kate Hutchins. I love her. Okay... Oh, yes, now I know who she is. That... Yes. Yeah, um, I don't mind. Um... Have you heard of, uh, Pierce Brosnan? Um, James Bond? Yeah. Yes, he's my favorite, um, actor, actually. Um, yeah. Yeah, do you have a favorite movie? I know it's childish. No, no, no, that's okay. I don't mind Toy Story as well. Like, all the children's, um, shows, like The Lion King, Toy Story... Yeah. Like the old versions, not the new ones. No, no. 'Cause the new ones are kind of stuffed up. Yeah. I think probably Toy Story and Toy Story 2 would probably be my best, yeah. Well, it's nice meeting you. Yeah. See you again. See ya! who he would like to see again. if the other person also chooses him. I'm actually leaning towards, uh, Evie, because I could see she was a nice girl, um, beautiful, um, her hair was good...  You've just gotta hope she chooses you too, hey? Yes. So, fingers crossed. Yep. Hey... Oh, are you heading off? Yeah, I'm heading off. So, it was very nice to meet you. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I'm really awkward with people. No, that's all right. It's your first time with me, you're a bit nervous and that, yeah. But nice meeting you. See ya Jared! See ya!  Yep. Hello.  How you doing? Good. I'm excited. Nervous, excited.  Oh, yeah? Yes.  In a good way? Yeah. It's different than last time. I feel more prepared than last time. I am going to wear... this, and this... and those shoes. to meet someone new. being eaten.  Hi. Hi. I'm Thomas.  I'm Olivia. Are you a hugger or a shaker? Both. Oh, well, bring it in. I'm very affectionate.  Me too.  Oh, I'm Thomas. Sorry. Do you have an accent? I like to think I've got the autism accent.  Oh. From all the, uh, video games and movies I watch. I've got a bit of Polish blood in me. Oh, nice. What do you like to do for fun? Play video games. Likewise.  Yes. I don't know about you, but I'm sensitive to sounds and smells... Not smells, but sounds. Sounds? Oh, yeah. And so, sometimes, when it comes to certain... abrupt sounds  or... Yes. ...odors, if you will... I just, like... I'm like, ""Okay, I'm out. Nope, I'm gone.""  Oh, hey.  Oh! I thought it'd better to go the soft-drink route rather than the alcohol route. I don't drink, so that's all right. That's all right, we'll... We shall enjoy our fine beverages. It's orange, like my hair. How long do you have to spend with your hair? Because it looks quite lovely. I didn't do anything today, I just brushed it. Really? Ah.  Yes. See, for me, I... I go through a vigorous schedule. I get mousse, I stylize it, and then I get, uh, my comb and I roll it through, and then I get some hair fiber and put it through. Huh? Sorry, I zoned out. Sorry, my bad. Oh, that's okay, I zone out too. So, you said you had a movement disorder? I think one of my, um, students on the spectrum has that as well. No, they don't. I guarantee they don't. Because no one in this world knows what it is. Really? Happens to the best of us.  Oh! It's all good. It was going so well. That's okay. I... I've already... I've forgotten it already. I'm a big fan of voluminous hair, and she had volume. And I was like, wow, that's great to see. Uh, then when we started talking, and I noticed that she was as lively as I was, it's always great to meet someone who shares your... types of, you know, engagement. It's always hard to speak with someone who is, you know, very shut off. Shall we get out of here?  Yes. Awesome. I know just a... A nice little walk along the weir. And I've got a little surprise for you, too, okay? Oh, I'm scared now! Oh, no, don't worry. Nothing's gonna come out of the bushes or whatever.  Did you want me to put the jumper on for you?  Yes.  Awesome. There you go. Yeah, just a generally nice person to be around and... quite... quite chatty. I think I've just discovered what it's like to hear myself for an hour. Oh, this is nice. Yeah. Uh, do you go for many walks along the water? No, but I always say I'm gonna do it, but I never do. I need to do it more. Yeah. So, I thought a little bit of a moonlight dance would be nice.  Oh, I can't remember what this dance was... I'm not quite sure either.  Something wrong? Please don't do that. You're making fun of my disability. No, I wasn't doing that. Sorry. I was actually dancing to the, uh... the beat. That's all. I... I... I'm sorry it came off like that. I didn't mean to do it. That's all right. I got to ask, how did you feel tonight went? Um... You can give me your honest opinion. It's not that... You know, I... I can take it. Ah... I think we got along pretty well. We did, yeah. If you want, um, we could catch up, maybe in the city? Uh... I'd like to talk online first for a while. That sounds like a good idea. Very amicable suggestion, indeed. Well, it was a pleasure to, uh, meet you. I'll see you around. Yep. Bye. Bye.  In your family, you feel like you're the only one who's still struggling to find someone. That's it. It feels, uh, sad, uh, a bit upset... Because I want to actually start my own family, um, um, as soon as possible, and that.  So you feel you're running out of time? Yes. Still nothing. if he has a match. ""Hi, Andrew. Thank you for attending our Sen speed dating. Your matches for the evening are as follows: Evie. The next step is up to you.""  So that's good news. Yes, excellent.  How do you feel about that? Very excited. Actually, very pleased with myself.  Well done. Thank you. High five!"
Love On The Spectrum,01,05,"""Hi. I'm really sorry, but I can't go out with you today, or for a while. I'm going through some very personal stuff. Sorry for wasting your time. Evie."" Um, I... And then I replied back, saying, um, ""Hi, Evie. Not a problem. I totally understand. Let me know when you are feeling much better, if you want to catch up for a coffee."" And then, that's it.  It sounded like things were looking good, and then... she changed her mind? Yes.  Hi. Hi, I'm Sharnae, and I'm 21 years old, and I'm on the spectrum.  Describe for me what your ideal partner would be like. Caring, amazing, good-looking. Jimmy? Come here. Hello. James. Yeah. You have to look at him. Hey.  You feeling a bit stressed? I'm here. Look at me. Hello. We'll do it together.  How long have you known each other? Two years. Yeah, two. A-Almost three. Almost three years. Yeah.  What did you think when you first met, Jimmy? just thought I was attractive. He's sexy. I was just, like, ""Mum, there's this hot guy at Job Centre. I... I'm gonna ask him out."" At that point, I didn't even know I was on the spectrum. I just knew I was different. And Sharnae just... She just felt similar to me, but... more like she just knew what I was... what I was thinking. Even before I was diagnosed, she just called me autistic, or told everyone I was autistic... Yeah. Pretty much. ...'cause she believed it so much. I did.  How old were you when diagnosed, Jimmy? Well, I was 20. I'm 21 now.  Wow. I don't know how they missed it.  What did you think when you were diagnosed? I didn't change.  Why do you think you guys are compatible?  Are you compatible? I hope so.  What does ""compatible"" mean? Compatible means, uh, do we have... Do we... Do we go well together? Oh, yeah. Sorry, I didn't know what that word meant. Yes, we do. We were made for each other. I love Sharnae. I love Jimmy.  Ooh.   I've got you.  Ooh, thank you. That's okay. Yep, and put that in the cupboard.  So, there's two knives and two forks?  Yeah, and two plates.  Yes.  What if you have guests? They can bring their own. Paper plates.  Or bring their own. Or bring their own plates and cutlery. It makes sense. It does. Yeah.  Yeah.  Did Sharnae make that?  Yeah.    Oh, goodness, what's this?  Oh, wanna see it?    Me and her, printed on a blanket. Yeah. It's really soft, too. So it's sensory. We like that kinda stuff, 'cause, yes, we're autistic, so we like sensory stuff.  Why do you put the eye masks on them? I don't know. It's just happy there. Yeah. It feels right.  Yeah.  Would you say this is a big step in your relationship? Oh, yes. Yeah, very big. Yeah. Yeah, the biggest so far. We've been wanting to do it for ages now, so... about time we move in together. Yeah. Yeah. Found a house, perfect. Yeah.  What's all this, Jimmy?  They're all my puzzles.  He lines it all up.  I was making sure it was nice.  It looks good.  How long does it take to solve a Rubik's Cube? I like to get sub-one-minute, but... mostly around the one-minute mark.  What is it you love about doing these puzzles?  I don't know, they're kind of just cool. I originally got the Rubik's Cube to keep my fingers and hands busy when I'm anxious, and I still like them.  Did you just finish it?  Yeah.  So you like solving things in your brain. I like to solve things in my brain, yeah. I see pool like that, as well. Every rack is a different puzzle. I c... I see it all before it all goes down. They're small, easy puzzles, but they're still puzzles. That must be my pool table.  Yeah, let's go see it! Dun-da-da! Okay. Come on, hold my hand. Okay. Come on.  Okay.  Hello. Out the back? That way. Yeah? Yep. in his backyard.  Wow, there we go.  It definitely fits, then.  Are you a pro player, Jimmy?  Nope. Yes.  You've only been playing pool for like... Two years. Yeah.  Only two years? That's not long. No, it's not. He's already off the rails. Like, really, really good. It's possible that it's an obsession. It's all I can think about, so...  Just Sharnae and pool. Yeah.  Yeah. Yep. Indeed.  Do you guys remember your first date? Yes. The movies.  Did you watch the movie? Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, it's a cinema. Why else would you go to the movies? Some do it to make out, that's what he meant. Oh, did he? Yeah. That's what he meant, isn't it? No. The movies are too good. Yeah, it was a good movie. We holded hands the whole time... Held. We hold han... held hands the whole time, and our arms were getting dead. And pins and needles, really hurting. That's what we thought that you do on first dates. I wasn't... I wasn't sure of the protocol. Yeah. I didn't know, because I'd never been on a date before, so I thought it was normal too. So... And then we kissed on the first date, too, so...  Ooh. Yeah. And then pretty much after that, he asked me out. Straight after. And then we were official. Isn't that right? And then Facebook official. I don't like kissing. Kissing's scary.  Don't do tongue. No, I just don't like it. It just feels weird. It's like a lizard. Stop that.  We do kiss.  Oh, nah...  Yeah, we do.  We do.  Yeah, of course. And we hold hands for, like, ten seconds.  About. About ten. Five to ten seconds, never above ten, but never below five.  Yeah. True that, yeah. And I'm fine with that. I don't... I don't really mind.  Is intimacy important in a relationship? Intimacy... Intimacy's easy. Yeah. Yeah, it's easy.  You don't have to answer. Have you guys consummated your relationship? No, I actually do know what it means. Yes. Obviously. As I said, it's easy. That stuff's easy. Yeah.   What do you think would be the biggest challenge for you in dating, or in a relationship? Probably, um, that, um...  uh, good conversation, and especially eye contact as well.  So, communication? Uh, yes. has come to work with him  Hi, I'm Andrew. Come in. Nice to meet you. I'm Jodi.  Jodi, nice to meet you. Come... Come on in.  I absolutely love working with people on the autism spectrum, because every single person is really different, and the things that they're skilled at, or their special interests are really amazing. I learn something different about being on the spectrum from every single person that I meet. All right, so... what do you want a girlfriend for? Just, um, like, um, start my own family and that. To be a good father, and also to keep the family name going and that... That's a very traditional way of thinking, isn't it? Yes. So, what's the very first step for this plan? It's get a girlfriend. Exactly. Yeah. So, when you went on the speed dating, did you meet anyone? Um, there... there was this, um, young, um, lady by the name of Evie. But then she came down with some, um, like, personal issues and that. So, I... I do have the, um, text here. So... So, just, um, from that there. ""Hi, I'm really sorry, but I can't go out with you today, or for a while."" Oh. How did... When you get a message like that... Yep. ...what did you think? Um, I felt a... a bit down, and a bit, um, upset and that. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that that means there is a future possibility of going out, or do you think that means that's the end of this? I think maybe there'll be a possibility in the... the future and that. But sometimes the words that come out of our mouth... Yeah. ...are not really what we're thinking. When somebody actually says, ""I'm so sorry, I can't get together... dot, dot, dot, dot, dot... for a while,"" what do you think she's thinking? Mmm.  Yeah, that's a really hard question. This is the... one of the hardest parts about relationships. Because... in her mind, she was probably thinking to herself, ""I like the look of that Andrew fella."" And then she's thinking, he's not boyfriend material."" Okay. We're strange, humans. Because rather than just sending a text saying, ""Great to get to know you... Yeah. ...but you are not boyfriend material.""  Hmm. Instead of saying things how they really are, what we do is we try and make another person feel okay.  Okay. Yep. And do you think Evie wanted to hurt your feelings? No, she... No way! No. How many dates had you been on before meeting Evie at speed dating? None. None?! No. It takes a lot of dates before you find the right person for you. Yes. Doesn't it? Mmm. So, that's good practice for the next date that's gonna happen. Okay. Do you find body language difficult? I think, um, when I was in school, um, yes. I don't know if I still do, actually. Okay, so if you wanted to show a girl that you're really into what she's saying, what would you do with your face? That's quite good. I like the... the eyes opening up like this. Mmm. If you're going to meet someone, do you practice? I think, like, I normally have like a script in my head, like what questions I'm going to ask her and that. All right, so tell me the questions when you would go on a... a date with somebody.  How old are they. Um, do you work? Um, do you have any hobbies that you like? Do you live with your, um, parents?  All right, so here's your list of questions. You take hold of that one. Yep. I'm meeting you for the first time, so I'm gonna have a list of questions, too, in my head, that are important. All right, you start the conversation, and we'll see if you can actually keep it going. Yep. Okay, how old are you? Twenty-one. Um, what do you do for work? I work with plants. Um, do you have any hobbies or interests? I like going to the gym... and I like doing jigsaw puzzles. Oh, very good. I like doing jigsaw puzzles as well. Um... Do you live with your parents or do you live by yourself? I live by myself.  Okay. Hmm. That's about it.  Yeah, I know. It's hard, isn't it? I know, very hard and that. Every time... there's a question...  Yep.  ...and we have an answer, we think to ourselves, ""How could I keep them talking about that?"" Hmm. Because otherwise, we go on a date, we have four questions... Yeah. ...the date could be finished in three minutes. So let's practice again. H-How old are you? I am 21.  Hmm. Have you had your 21st birthday yet? Excellent! There you go. Oh, yes, I had a great 21st birthday party.  Hmm. Three of my friends went to the movies. Okay. When you did go to the movies with your friends, what movie did you go and see? You're good. That's excellent. I went and saw Fast and the Furious 3. Oh! Well, that... I like the Fast and the Furious, um, movies. I prefer, uh, number six, actually. Look at us. What have we just found out together? Very interested in movies. How did you show me with your face? Ah, well done! Up with your eyebrows. You... I saw it. So you need to know, you can do this. Autism isn't stagnant. People develop, and they change, and you can see with Andrew that he's learnt a lot of skill about social connection with other people. But it's quite rigid. Thank you for coming and, um, teaching me some things. Andrew needs support to understand how do we follow and continue and keep a conversation going with another person, so a date doesn't finish in three and a half seconds and feel like an interrogation. And, um, have a good day.  Thank you. See you later. See you, Jodi.  What's the hardest thing about being on the spectrum? We do get major anxiety. We get busy heads. So sometimes, you know, like a roller coaster. Well, it's just... I think it's just annoying when other people just don't see what I see.  Hmm.  Is change hard to deal with? Change is like a bad holiday.  Yeah. I like holidays, but I don't like changes much. Change. I like planned change.  Yeah. So if you can plan change, it's very, very good. Easier. And if we... Yeah, if we get it on the spot, we're like, ""Oh,"" you know? Yeah, it freaks me out. Yeah, it freaks us out. Sometimes it will...  Yeah. ...ruin my whole night, even for pool. Yeah. I'll turn up expecting one thing, and then something might go wrong, and it will make the whole night a lot harder.  See ya later.  I don't think I can do it.  You don't have to, Jimmy. I just can't. Maybe in different circumstances. I just don't... think so.  You don't think so? Wanna have a drink, see how you feel? I want lemon, lime, and bitters. Lemon, lime, and bitters now? Yes. Yes, okay.  Is it that you don't want to play pool, or...? I want to play pool, I just don't... think so.  Is it 'cause we're here? Or is it 'cause there's... People.  People you don't know? I don't know these guys. If it was like a normal night, everyone in this... this whole room, I would know. But it's not like that at all. I don't know if I can do this. I don't know... Here, have a drink. Thanks. A little bit of freak-out, yeah? No, I'm having a lot of bit of freak-out. I know. Righty-o. Best of three, gentlemen. So, that's the game. Thanks. Yeah.  No need to be nervous.  All good. Righty-o, gentlemen. Best of luck. Round two. You good? Yeah.  Whoa, that was good, wasn't it? I like it. Thanks. Well done! Jimmy, well done. Yeah, thanks. That money's yours. Milady...  Thank you, sir.  How are you feeling about the dates you went on? There were a couple of things where my filter got in the way. A couple of things where I was wishing... Internally wishing I hadn't said it, and stuff like that. First dates never really go... never... never really are good, are they?  What's autism feel like for you? It's like being in a transparent box. No one can hear you, no one can... They can see you, but they can't interact with you. You can bang on the wall, but you can't get out of it, so it's very lonely being in the box your entire life. 'Cause no one can get in, and you can't get out. And no one can understand you. to meet someone new. Hi, I'm Jackson. I'm Olivia. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. You look lovely. Thank you. Well, yes. Yeah. Bit hard to sit down on these chairs. Whereabouts in Central Coast are you from? Gosford. So am I! I live in North Gosford. Oh, really? No way! Yes. So close to each other. That's so weird.  Yeah, it is weird, isn't it? What do you like to do? I'm a gamer. What sort of games? Planning to get the new Mortal Kombat game. Oh, that's a good game, yeah. So, like, anything else you do, like your hobbies, or...? Um, well, I'm an actor. Oh, are you? Wow. Yes, with a theater company for disabled people. Really? Yeah. Oh, cool. My autism helps me with that a lot. Also, being very emotional, which comes from my autism, so... My, uh, autism gives me a very creative side. Yeah. Uh, but I also have very high thinking, but I'm, like, slow, uh, motor speeds. When I was really little, I used to just go round banging my head on shit, just for the fun of it. Would you like to get a drink or coffee? I don't drink coffee, I'd like a drink. Yeah. I'll go get you one. Yeah.  I'll be back in just a sec. Yep.  So, what do you think? I'm liking. I know you've been wanting to hear that for about three dates now.  Here you are. I wasn't diagnosed till I was 18. Yeah, about the same for me. I think 19, maybe.  It's the anniversary next week, actually, because I was diagnosed two days before my 18th birthday. Oh, were you? Yes. Oh, okay. Up until then, I didn't have any disability help whatsoever. You never got any help whatsoever? No. I almost had to repeat, even with support, so that's amazing. I do have social difficulties. Problem is... they overlooked my symptoms, because, as a child, none of my symptoms were out of place for a child that age. Oh, really? Because it presents differently in girls, and there's no criteria for girls. Oh, that's a bit silly.  Yeah, I know. Which is why I got...  Whoa, sorry.  Overlooked. It is.   But you're right, now. You're having some trouble here and there, and I have some trouble time to time, too, but, you know, uh, I think you're very lovely, and, uh, I don't think there's anything really that wrong with you.  Aww.  Uh, I've organized a pottery class. Would you like to go do that with me? Yeah, sure. Really? Yeah. All right. Well, good. Let's go!  I think she's very sweet and she's very cute too. I like that she can laugh at anything. That's very nice. You still a bit cold? Yeah, but nothing you can do about it. Would you like my jacket? You sure? Yeah, have my jacket.  Thank you. She's also got pretty red hair. I can be a bit of a sucker for redheads.  Do you want me to make something for you or something? Maybe I can make a controller for you, since you're so into games. All right. We're going all Ghost on this date, with pottery. I can't imagine how they would've done that scene. Uh, well, probably would have to do a lot of retakes.  It's a bit creepy, because he's a ghost. Yeah. A bit touchy-feely. Maybe I would do something like that, but not on camera, I think. That's something couples do in private, I think. Yeah.  There you go. PlayStation controller. Yay!   Thank you. I really enjoyed the day, and I enjoyed your company. I just really want to get to know you more. You know? Same. Would you like to do this again? Yeah, sure! Can I get your number? Sure, um... Um... Here. Put the game on pause. Uh...   Okay. Save... Olivia. Mine can take a picture, so I'll take a picture of you. All right. So, um, maybe we'll do this again some other time, yeah? Yeah, I'd love to. All right. Yeah. Let's go.  Let's go.  What do you guys dream about for your future together? Well, we wanna get married one day, but first, we're gonna travel. I wanna just do all of the things that Sharnae never thought she would be able to do. Breathe in the Gold Coast air. for tomorrow.  Hey, you! Hello. What are you doing?  What have you got planned for your holiday?  We're going to theme parks. We're also going to a romantic dinner together.  Ooh! Ooh!  Yeah, we don't usually go on romantic dates, because that means you have to go to restaurants, and that means you have to go to places where people are. We have dinner at our house, that's romantic. Ooh.  Ooh.  Here to check in. Lovely. Yes. Just a photo ID for check-in. There you go. So just reconfirming, you've booked a one-bedroom ocean spa apartment for three nights. Yeah! Fancy. This is the rules. It just says don't lose the keys... Yeah, we don't do that. We follow rules. Perfect. So, just both names and signatures. We love rules.   Right there. Ooh.  Oh, my God. Whoa, this is pretty cool!  There's flowers. Oh, chocolates! Ooh, fancy. Are they chocolates or soap? No, chocolate.  Oh, cool. These spoons are the wrong way around, though.  Holy shit! We got a bath!  Oh, look at the bath! Look at that! Look at that!  Oh, my...  God!  ...God! That's so cool. Holy shit!  Whoo! Wanna go out on the veranda? It's raining. Here we go. It's gonna be scary. I can't open it.  I'm so weak. That way. Together. Go.  We're gonna break it.  There's a technique. What do you do?  I don't know! No... You would think, with our beautiful minds, we'd be able to open a freaking door. Wait, this one might open. Nah, key.  We don't have a key, but we can go out here. Oh, my Lord!  Aah! Oh, my God! We could die. Shh! Don't touch it! Oh, look at the ocean view! Isn't it beautiful at nighttime?  Isn't it just?  Wee! It's nice and comfy. Yeah.  Aah! Aah.  Mmm.  Aah!    Yeah. Uh-oh! They could've died. Yeah, man. Gotta wait for the green light. Rules are rules. I'm gonna go on this. Wee! Go this way. Nae!  That was fun.  You're crazy.  By the way, have you noticed we actually hold hands for longer than five seconds of duration?  True!  When did that change? Um... I don't know. Jimmy's getting used to it more.  Is that a holiday rule? Yeah, no. No, I think I just wanna be... as close to Sharnae at all times... Yeah. 'cause she is my friend. I love it. I love you. Yuck! Can I kiss you? No! Why? We're still on camera.  I don't care about the cameras. It's just me and you.    What's happening tonight? Tonight me and Jimmy are going on a romantic dinner.  So exciting. I'm getting all ready for it. This outfit I got from the shops. It looks like a dress, but it's pants.  Very cute. Dress... pants. Dress... pants. Dress... pants. Hello. You're looking good! Gonna put your jacket on?  He's looking very handsome. Yes, very handsome. Very nice, sexy boy.  Hmm. I need navy socks. You should get some navy socks. Should've got navy socks. Idiot. Pants are a bit longer.  Navy socks. When you get a navy suit, get navy socks.  Yeah. Brown shoes go with navy suits, not black shoes. But black socks definitely don't go with navy suits. No.  I need navy socks.  Yes.  Is there a store around here... Maybe tomorrow. It's too late. Get my bag. Look, 'cause if I go like this...  Yep, we know.  Like that... Black socks don't go with...  Yep. We'll get navy socks.  Idiot.  Got your cube? Can you get them ones, please? Ready to go now? You gonna do that first?  You're a bit... You're upset, aren't you? Yes.  Navy socks.  What do we do now? Get navy socks. Yeah, we'll go get navy socks now. Come on.  All right, bye. I'm going to buy navy socks. I need navy socks.  Have any rules for dating?
