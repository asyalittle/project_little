Step 1: The original data for the speakers on Love on the Spectrum comes from opensubtitles.org. In order to acquire this data, navigate to the site listed above.

Step 2: From there, in the Search Bar, type in the title of the show (Love on the Spectrum). We will be looking at the transcripts from each episode of Season 1. 

Step 3: After clicking an episode, scroll to find the transcript in your preferred/desired language (for me, this will be English).

Step 4: Finally, you hit download at the top of the page, unzip the zip.file, and open the .srt file with the desired application (i.e., TextEdit).

Steps 3 and 4 will be repeated for all episodes of Season 1 on Love on the Spectrum and then for our other Television Show, Love is Blind (episodes 1, 2, 3, 6 and 10).
