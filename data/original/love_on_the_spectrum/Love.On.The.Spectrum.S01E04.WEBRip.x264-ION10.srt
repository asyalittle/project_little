1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,280
I'm just... I'm just worried
because I can't see your face.

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,560
I think that glass on the angle... yeah.

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,600
[Cian] How is it? Better?

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
Uh, no, I think you made it a bit worse.
I think...

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,760
Whoo, I... Yeah, that's perfect.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,840
- [Cian] Yeah?
- Yep.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,640
My name is Andrew.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,280
I'm 27 years old.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,200
I work at Family and Community Services
in Newcastle.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,160
And I want to find a girlfriend
for some love.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,200
[Cian] How would you describe yourself?

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,240
Polite, on time,

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
uh, cute...

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,360
organized, as well...

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,160
f-f-f-funny.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,040
- [Cian] How are you funny?
- Uh...

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,600
Like, sometimes I tend to, um...

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,480
make some f-funny jokes,

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,520
or different voices, as well.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,360
[Cian] What sort of voices do you do?

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,560
Let me think, um...

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,720
My name is Bond. James Bond.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,640
- [Cian] Which Bond was that?
- Uh, I think that was Sean Connery.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,560
But, yeah, I'm still getting,
like, used to it.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,720
Like, with the voice,
making it a bit deeper and that.

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,320
[Cian] How important would you say
it is to you to find someone special?

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,640
I think, to me,

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,840
it will be very important
to find someone, uh, for love.

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,696
[Cian] What would you rate it,
on a scale of one to ten, how important?

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,320
I think ten, actually.

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,200
[birds chirping]

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,520
[narrator] <i>Andrew's parents</i>
<i>are currently away on holiday...</i>

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,960
<i>leaving him in charge of the house.</i>

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,960
[Andrew] So, this is actually my bedroom.

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,360
This is my number one bear, Angus.

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,960
Most of the time,
he normally sits with me.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,560
So, this is Ernie.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,040
He's been my second favorite bear.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,600
I actually got him when I was
about six or seven years old,

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,880
from Santa.

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,400
And, um also,
the <i>Crocodile Dundee</i> hat, actually.

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,320
That's not a knife...

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,720
this is a knife.

44
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,320
So, this is my hobby room.

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,280
It'll give you a bit more idea
who I am and that, so...

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,800
A set of a jigsaw puzzles here.

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,640
Most of these old ships here
are very, uh, collective and, uh, fragile.

48
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,680
Here is a collection of my, uh, K'NEX.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,720
So, this is a six-foot clock tower
which I built.

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,360
It moves, as well.

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,880
So, this is a six-foot, uh, Ferris wheel

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,920
that I'm building at the moment,
which is, um, nearly complete.

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,920
[Cian] Do you think being
on the autism spectrum

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,240
kind of has something to do

55
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,040
with you having
these kind of strong interests in things?

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,880
I think so, yes.

57
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,040
[Cian] Sounds like
you like to follow the rules.

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes. Yeah, rules and procedures,
I'm very strict on those.

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,640
[Andrew] Get yourself plenty of ice.

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,240
That much will be fine.

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,200
My favorite drink is a Sex on the Beach.

62
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,840
- [Cian] And that's a cocktail?
- Yes.

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,920
[Andrew] Thirty mils
of the peach schnapps,

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,280
then 30 mils of, um, the vodka,

65
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,360
Just stop for a second.

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,880
I've made this wrong.

67
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,920
It was supposed to go in this first.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
[Cian] Oh, no!

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,040
[Andrew] Try again.

70
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,240
Thirty mils of the peach schnapps,

71
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,840
in there... there we go.

72
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,720
You will need 90 mils orange juice.

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,880
90 mils of the cranberry juice.

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,520
Shake it without the ice
for about ten seconds...

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,240
And that's how you make
a Sex on the Beach.

76
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
[smacks lips]

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,480
Ahh.

78
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,640
Perfection.

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
[smacks lips] Delicious.

80
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
[Cian] Have you ever kissed anyone, Mark?

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,880
Like, a girl?

82
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
No.

83
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Never.

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,520
[Cian] Something you would like to do?

85
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Oh, yes.

86
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,240
I mean, that would...

87
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,720
be quite an experience.

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,040
A very huge experience for me.

89
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,200
[narrator] <i>Mark is at the zoo,</i>

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,000
<i>waiting for his date to arrive.</i>

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
I can't wait to see what she's like.

92
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,040
Yeah, I really am excited
and feel really good.

93
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,520
[narrator] <i>Mark is meeting Lauren.</i>

94
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,640
<i>Lauren likes popping Bubble Wrap...</i>

95
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,840
[popping]

96
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,720
<i>...and the sound of the ocean.</i>

<i>She hates escalators...</i>

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,440
<i>and being chased by chickens.</i>

100
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
[clucks]

101
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,360
- Hello.
- [chuckling] Hey.

102
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,120
Nice to meet you, I'm Mark.

103
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,040
Hi, I'm Lauren.

104
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,720
- Nice to meet you, Lauren.
- Hi!

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,080
Sorry. I wanted to wave,
but, like, with my crutches...

106
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
Oh, no, that's... that's...

107
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,280
that's perfectly all right. That's...

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,240
- That's nothing to worry about.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,200
How are you?

110
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,016
- I'm good, thanks. How are you?
- Looking...

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,960
I'm... great. I'm really excited to this.

112
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,320
Yeah, it's so cool.

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,240
[Mark chuckles]

114
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,240
- So...
- So...

115
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,360
Shall we go in?

116
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.

117
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Just take your time.

118
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,496
- Yeah, thanks.
- You know, don't want to rush you.

119
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
[Lauren] No. It's all right.

120
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,760
[clucking]

121
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,440
So have you visited any places on Earth?

122
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,120
I've only had, like, one major...

123
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,560
um, overseas holiday.

124
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,840
- That was last year.
- Yeah.

125
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,160
So, um, my aunt, who lives in China...

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,280
Oh, okay.

127
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,480
Yeah, she was getting married over there.

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,840
[Mark] I've always wanted to go to China.

129
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
- Let me tell you a bit about myself.
- [Lauren] Yeah.

130
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,640
My favorite animals of all time
are dinosaurs.

131
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,800
When I saw <i>Jurassic Park,</i>
it changed my life, and...

132
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
- [Lauren] Oh really?
- Yeah.

133
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,120
- Okay, that's interesting.
- I read all sorts of books on dinosaurs...

134
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,320
- Yeah?
- ...and paleontology, and it...

135
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,480
Okay, cool.

136
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,120
- And I even...
- Like Ross, in <i>Friends.</i>

137
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,560
[Mark] I also love birds,

138
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,880
since birds are the closest
living relatives of dinosaurs.

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
That's true, yeah.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
[trumpets]

141
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,560
- Oh, that's so cute.
- Aww.

142
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,280
It's very sad
there's not many left of them.

143
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,040
[Mark] Yeah, and sadly,
some of them have been

144
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,000
- hunted into extinction by poachers.
- [Lauren] Hmm.

145
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,840
[Mark] During the Ice Age,

146
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,080
the mammoths and the mastodons
were hunted for their meat.

147
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
- Oh, yeah.
- You know?

148
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,400
You would think that we would have
learned our lessons, but...

149
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,560
- Yeah.
- ...the tragedy is, we're still doing...

150
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,800
horrible stuff to these beautiful,
intelligent animals

151
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,920
that have the right to live peacefully
on our planet.

152
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,720
I don't know if you've heard,
but they have good memories.

153
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
- Ah, yes! Yes, that's right.
- [Lauren] Yeah. I think...

154
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
I have no short-term memory.

155
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,360
I have to see people
quite a few times before I remember them.

156
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,280
- [Mark] Oh, okay. Right.
- So...

157
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,080
I'm thinking I should hire an elephant,

158
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,840
I'll teach it to talk...

159
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,160
Yeah. [laughs]

160
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
...and then, it can just follow me around,

161
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,160
and it can be my personal memory keeper.

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,760
[laughs]

163
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,760
- [Mark] This is the cassowaries.
- [Lauren] They're such pretty animals.

164
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,240
[Mark] Yeah, they're very beautiful,
but they have a really nasty attitude.

165
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,720
They've actually killed people.

166
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,080
- I mean, you see that?
- Really?

167
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,480
Those feet look like very useful
for disemboweling its victims.

168
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Put it this way, they're the closest
as we can get to a raptor dinosaur.

169
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,400
- [low rumble]
- Oh.

170
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,360
[Lauren] Oh, that's a weird noise.

171
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,520
That's not a good noise.

172
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
[low rumble]

173
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,640
- Is it gonna start charging?
- I think it's best just to leave them.

174
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Yeah, we'll move on.

175
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,160
- See you, guys.
- See ya.

176
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,720
Oh, she's a very wonderful, charming girl.

177
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,200
She loves animals, and...

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,280
really, I'm impressed by her enthusiasm
and her admiration and respect.

179
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
[Cian] Do you think
there's any romance in the air?

180
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
[chuckles]

181
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,840
That's a bit up in the air at the moment.
I can't say for sure.

182
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,080
But, you know, we'll just have to wait
to see if that spark can be ignited.

183
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,920
[Cian] Would you like for that spark
to be ignited?

184
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,680
Yes. Yes.

185
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,800
I've arranged to see
a penguin-feeding show.

186
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, awesome! Oh, thank you.

187
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,336
- I thought you would love to...
- That's very cool. Yeah.

188
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,280
- I do love penguins.
- So, you want to go and check it out?

189
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,600
Yeah, that'd be great!

190
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,560
- Because I have cerebral palsy...
- [Mark]Yeah.

191
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,200
...my favorite thing about penguins
is that they walk funny.

192
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,576
- Okay.
- And I just love the fact

193
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,880
that there's an animal
that walks like I walk.

194
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,520
[Mark laughs]

195
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,120
These are the little penguins. You have
the opportunity to feed them if you want.

196
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,160
- [Lauren and Mark gasp]
- Absolutely!

197
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,480
[chirping]

198
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,560
Which one of you lucky guys
is gonna get the fish?

199
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,880
Here you go.

200
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,080
Aw, you look so cute!

201
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,760
Waddle, waddle, waddle.

202
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
They walk like me!

203
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,640
Is it true that penguins
will choose a partner

204
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,240
and then stick with them for life?

205
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,040
- [Lauren] Is that actually true?
- Exactly.

206
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,640
And they sometimes will select the nest

207
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,760
as to how well the male
has actually built the nest.

208
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,760
- Oh.
- Oh, yes.

209
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,560
So if you're keeping a nice house,
then you'll bring the girls in.

210
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,600
We took a ferry to Manly,

211
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
- once upon a time here.
- Oh, yeah? Nice.

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,480
- Yes.
- Yeah.

213
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,600
It was beautiful, you know.

214
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,520
Yeah, the Manly ferry's lovely.

215
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,160
- Oh, definitely, and...
- Yeah.

216
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,480
We should do a Manly ferry trip one time.

217
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,016
- That would be great.
- Would be nice.

218
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,520
[Mark] I've always wanted to go
back on the ferry again.

219
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
- [Mark chuckles]
- Yeah, so we should, um...

220
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,360
do that one time, maybe.

221
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,600
- Oh, I look forward to that.
- Yeah.

222
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,200
[Cian] Sounded to me like you might
have asked Mark out on a second date.

223
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Um...

224
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,240
I... I may have, yeah. [chuckles]

225
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,480
I... I just...
He was really nice, and I thought...

226
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,640
it'd be cool to catch up again.

227
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,560
Yeah.

228
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,360
Well, thank you for that.

229
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,560
- No, thank you. It was wonderful.
- I hope we meet each other again.

230
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,960
- Yeah, definitely, we'll have to catch up.
- Oh, yes.

231
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,880
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

232
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
For sure. That was great.

233
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,920
- You take care of yourself, and...
- Thank you. Yes.

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Um...

235
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,200
Could I, um, maybe give you a hug?

236
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,800
- Is that all right? Yeah.
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

237
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,280
- Oh.
- [Lauren speaks indistinctly]

238
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,416
- I had...
- I like your shirt.

239
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,240
Thank you.
I had a great time with you, and...

240
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,200
Yeah, it was great.

241
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,320
You know,
I hope we look forward to this again.

242
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,160
Yeah, we'll definitely catch up.

243
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Bye!

244
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
[Mark] Bye-bye!

245
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,240
[Cian] It sounded like she asked you
on a second date on the gondola.

246
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,080
Yes.Absolutely.

247
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Absolutely.

248
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,720
- [Cian] That's pretty exciting.
- Yes.

249
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,640
So, I look forward to that, very soon.

250
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,840
Great. Can't wait.

251
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,320
I'm so nervous.

252
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
[Cian] Why?

253
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,040
Because I've never done this before.

254
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,760
Hi, my name's Olivia, uh...

255
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,680
I'm 25, and, um...

256
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,000
I have, uh, ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder.

257
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,720
And I am...

258
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
single.

259
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
[Cian] How long have you been single for?

260
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Uh...

261
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,720
What's today?

262
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Uh...

263
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,600
My whole life.

264
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,000
[Cian] What would it mean for you
to find love?

265
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,040
Amazing, I guess.

266
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,080
I don't know. I never thought about it.
[chuckles]

267
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,520
'Cause I didn't think
it was ever going to happen, so...

268
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
[Cian] Why don't you think it'll happen?

269
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,760
Ninety-five percent of all people
with autism don't find someone, so...

270
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,000
probably just end up being
another statistic, I guess.

271
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,760
[Cian] Where did you get that figure from?

272
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,336
I don't know. It could be incorrect.
I found it online somewhere.

273
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,160
[Cian] Why do you think so many people
on the spectrum don't find love?

274
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
I guess because of
our social difficulties, I suppose.

275
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Oops. [chuckles]

276
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,840
[Cian] Do you ever look at online dating?

277
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,960
No. I've been too scared.

278
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,240
[Cian] Why is it scary?

279
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,280
Because on the internet,
you can be anyone,

280
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,240
and you don't know that... who they are.

281
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
I'll show you.

282
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,640
As the meme says, "On the internet,
no one knows you're a cat." [laughs]

283
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,160
I love cats.

284
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,536
This is a Christmas present to myself.
Her name is Duchess.

285
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,400
I call all my cats "Duchess."
I'm not sure why.

286
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,080
[meows]

287
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,080
[purrs]

288
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,560
- [chuckles]
- [meows]

289
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,880
It's supposed to walk,
but this carpet's here, so it's stuck.

290
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,320
- [meows]
- [Cian] Is that cat's name Duchess?

291
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
- [Olivia] It doesn't have one.
- [Cian] Why not?

292
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
Because I hate that cat.

293
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,760
[Cian] What's it like,
being a girl on the spectrum?

294
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,760
Extremely difficult,
considering that there's no girl criteria.

295
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
It's only boy.

296
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,760
So you get... you get assessed
on how male you are.

297
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,000
This has been out all week,
I should fold it.

298
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,320
[narrator] <i>Olivia was diagnosed</i>
<i>with autism when she was 18.</i>

299
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,320
<i>Girls are often diagnosed later than boys</i>

300
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,120
<i>and are sometimes missed
until well into adulthood.</i>

301
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,480
[Cian] What's important to you in life?

302
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,680
Acting. Uh, performing.

303
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,560
That... that is my life.
That's who I am. It's my identity.

304
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,960
I go to Options Theater Company.

305
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,960
It's a, uh, theater company
for people with disabilities.

306
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,440
It's my home. It's my family.

307
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,016
Without them, I don't know where...
I don't know, uh, where I'd be.

308
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
It... it changed my life.

309
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,200
- [Olivia] Morning, Stuart.
- Morning, Olivia. Have you got a script?

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,280
Ah, no, because I didn't realize I was
gonna be doing my monologue today,

311
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,920
- on a Monday.
- You'll be all right.

312
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,520
I had a hard life, growing up.

313
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,880
So, Olivia playing Oberon.

314
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,400
[Olivia] When I came here,
I felt safe for the first time in my life.

315
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,800
I was finally with people
who understood me.

316
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,720
Where is my puck?

317
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,680
Over the shoulder.

318
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,280
And who get that I was different
to other people, and treated me right.

319
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,760
The trick that's coming in now
is that you're setting the theme up

320
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,960
for <i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

321
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,800
And that's why you're giving her
the flower.

322
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,200
The course of true love
never did run smooth.

323
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,040
Of course it doesn't. [chuckles]

324
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,720
Oh, got some feelings about that?
Have you been in love before?

325
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,120
- [Olivia] I have.
- Have you? Did it break your heart?

326
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,880
- Yes. [laughs]
- [Stuart] Yes.

327
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,096
- Yeah, but you know the feeling, right?
- [Olivia] Yeah.

328
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,440
And that's why... That's why Oberon
is so powerful, so mischievous.

329
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,720
He's scorned.

330
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
That's why he's doing this.

331
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
Hell hath no fury
like a fairy king scorned.

332
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,920
- Hell hath no fury like a fairy...
- [Olivia laughs]

333
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,960
- Maybe that should be on the poster.
- [laughing]

334
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,280
[Cian] You're jumping around a bit,
Olivia.

335
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,880
Yeah, it's called disability.

336
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,040
I jump around like a ping-pong ball
when I'm happy or excited,

337
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,440
or anxious, or nervous, or stressed.

338
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Um, those the only main triggers
I know of.

339
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,760
- [Olivia laughing]
- [man speaking indistinctly]

340
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,880
[Olivia] At one point,
we thought it was Tourette's.

341
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,960
Another time, we thought
it was chronic motor tic disorder.

342
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,600
Many different theories, but no cigar.
[slight chuckle]

343
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,440
[Cian] And how long
has that been around for?

344
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,880
From the moment I was aware of it.
I was born with it.

345
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,640
[Cian] What does it feel like?

346
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,800
It's a massive build-up
with a pleasant release.

347
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,480
[laughing]

348
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,160
[laughing]

349
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,040
[Cian] So, have you ever been in love?

350
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,720
No.

351
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
- [Cian] Have you been in a relationship?
- No.

352
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,240
- [Cian] Have you been on a date?
- No.

353
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,160
Yeah, so, at the moment,
with my dating history,

354
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,120
I think it's, uh, pretty poor
at the moment.

355
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,160
[Cian] So, there is no dating history.

356
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Yes.

357
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,000
[narrator] <i>Today, Andrew is preparing</i>
<i>for the arrival of his parents,</i>

358
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,880
<i>who are returning home
from their overseas holiday.</i>

359
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,720
- [Cian] You like things to be clean?
- Oh, yes.

360
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,960
Yeah, they'll be home soon.

361
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,000
Just waiting for them
to come down the street, actually.

362
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
[grunts]

363
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
[Andrew] Hi!

364
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,120
-Hello, sweetheart. How are you?

365
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,776
- [Andrew] Good.
- We missed you so much!

366
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,960
- I missed you too.
- Ooh, I just lost my sunglasses!

367
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,360
- That's okay.
- Never mind.

368
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,416
[mother] Oh, Andrew, you've done a good
job keeping the house nice and tidy.

369
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,280
[Andrew] Very good.

370
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,520
And here's something that we thought
you'd appreciate, Andrew, and all that.

371
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,520
Oh, thank you.

372
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,280
So, I'll put that with my other, um,
collection of boats, and that.

373
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,200
[Cian] So, Andrew's obviously keen
to find someone special.

374
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,800
What are your thoughts on that?

375
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,640
Oh, we would love him to find someone,

376
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,720
because I know how keen he is himself
to get a girlfriend, and...

377
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,640
and hopefully, one day, a wife.

378
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,200
Because Andrew loves going out.
He loves going out for dinner,

379
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,120
- and he loves going to the movies.
- Yep.

380
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,520
He just doesn't want to do it
with his mum and dad anymore.

381
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,400
[laughter]

382
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,920
Oh, I still do,
but because you're retired...

383
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,320
- [mother] Yes.
- ...you need your quiet time now.

384
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
[mother] Yes, plus, you don't want
to spend your life with your mum and dad.

385
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
No.

386
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,320
We've always told Andrew,
don't let anybody ever tell you

387
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,640
that you can't do something.

388
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,080
Andrew would always have a crack
and have a go at something.

389
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,640
Very proud of him.

390
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,840
Very proud of him.

391
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,160
I'd say he's a good boy,
but he's no longer a boy.

392
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,120
- No, I'm a man now.
- That's right. A good young man.

393
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,920
He's got the job
and he's got the license.

394
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,040
- So, now he needs the girlfriend. [laughs]
- That's it.

395
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,040
Andrew's ideal girl would be a girl
that loves jigsaw puzzles and K'NEX.

396
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,560
That would be... that would make it
for him for the rest of his life.

397
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,040
I just hope he finds someone
that he's happy with.

398
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,240
That's all we ever want for Andrew,
is to be happy.

399
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,080
He hasn't said it for a while,

400
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,960
but I have heard Andrew say in the past,

401
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,360
"I wish I was normal."

402
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,880
- [Cian] That must hurt a bit.
- Yeah, it does.

403
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,920
How does it make you feel
when you hear that?

404
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,680
[voice breaking] Pretty... pretty upset.

405
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
[Cian] Are you a romantic person?

406
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,800
Yes, I'm a hopeless romantic.

407
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
- [Cian] Yeah?
- [Olivia] Hmm.

408
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,240
I love love. I love love songs,
I love rom-coms.

409
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,640
Half my songs on my iPod are roma...
Are, uh, love songs and break-up songs.

410
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,560
[laughs]

411
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,080
[Cian] Have you ever experienced
unrequited love?

412
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,720
When have I not? [chuckles]

413
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,120
I'm usually the, uh, crusher,
not the crushee. [chuckles]

414
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,280
My feelings are never returned, normally.

415
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,280
[Cian] So you've had crushes?

416
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Many.

417
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,040
[Cian] And what... And what happens?

418
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,120
I get very heartbroken. [chuckles]

419
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Because all the guys always...
Always want to hang out with me.

420
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,480
They never want to hold my hand

421
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
or date me.

[Cian] What are your concerns?
What are you worried about?

That I have a brain freeze
and I don't know what to say.

430
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,840
[Cian] It sounds like your worries

you like the other person.

466
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Now there's no one around.

467
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,640
[laughs]

468
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,120
I'm... Again, I'm so sorry
that I waited so long.

469
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,600
I mean, that you waited... [groans]

470
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,160
All right, let me start again.

471
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,040
- I know that feeling. No filter.
- [Christopher] Ah.

472
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,600
Ironically though, it takes me to forever
to get all the thoughts out of my mouth.

473
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,760
I mean, sometimes I immediately think
that I need to, like, go on a script

474
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,880
as soon as I meet someone.

475
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,480
Then as soon as everything happens,

476
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,120
I just feel like a wall
just suddenly slams in there,

477
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,480
then I can't even start to think

478
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,640
until the whole thing's
over and done with.

479
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,200
Sorry, did I speak too fast?

480
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,280
No, I just... I zoned out. That's all.

481
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,040
I have this problem.

482
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,200
Um, I know exactly the feeling.
It takes me forever to try and, uh...

483
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,120
Concentrate.

484
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,040
- Yes.
- [Olivia] Focus.

485
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,320
- Uh-huh.
- [laughs] I have a focusing problem.

486
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,360
- Eh, trial and error.
- Don't you worry, I'm a bundle of nerves.

487
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,280
Cheers to a bundle of nerves, then.
And the birds.

488
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,960
[Olivia laughs]

489
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
[dog barks]

490
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
You okay?

491
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,000
Um...

492
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
Yeah, just got a phobia of big dogs,
that's all.

493
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,560
I used to be a dog groomer.

494
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,160
And trust me, that one's harmless.

495
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,360
Oh, no, I'm not scared of dogs,
just I'm scared of big dogs that jump.

496
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
Oh.

497
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,600
[Christopher] Truth be told,
I got pushed into dog grooming

498
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,720
because of what my mother wanted me to do.

499
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,840
I was more an actor and a writer
than anything else.

500
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm an actor.

501
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,560
I perform with a theater company
called Options Theater Company.

502
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,600
I would ask for, uh, contact details,
but it's a bit too far for me.

503
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,520
It's okay, you would not be
allowed in anyway.

504
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,120
It's a...
It's a disability theater company.

505
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,960
Don't know whether to take that
as an insult or not.

506
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,240
What is your disability?
'Cause I'm not seeing one.

507
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,400
No offense.

508
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,840
- What does autism look like to you?
- Point taken.

509
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,840
You should take your foot
out of your mouth, sir.

510
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,456
- [woman speaks indistinctly]
- Thank you.

511
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,200
I didn't know I had a foot in my mouth.

512
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,600
Thank you very much.

513
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,120
It is, when you say
you can't see a disability,

514
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,080
because not all disabilities are visible.

515
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,160
And just like that,
I just got proved how blind I am.

516
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,640
[Olivia chuckles]

517
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,160
I normally don't disclose my autism
straight away to people I meet.

518
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,280
I really don't know
how to properly describe myself,

519
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,240
other than just Asperger's syndrome.

520
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,360
That is autism.

521
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,880
I don't know, some people say
it's dyslexic, other people say autism.

522
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,600
At this point, I just want to say,
I'm a madman. Let's just go with that.

523
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,480
My diagnosis is Asperger's.

524
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,120
Hmm. [grunts]

525
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,680
But because Asperger's,
the term doesn't exist anymore,

526
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
we're all Autism Spectrum Disorder.

527
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,960
[coughing]

528
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
You okay?

529
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,880
I choke on everything. [coughs]
I'm not even sure why, I just do.

530
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
[coughs softly]

531
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,080
[Olivia] I like him.
He's a really nice guy.

532
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,400
A bit awkward, but I think
we're both like that, so... [laughs]

533
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,296
I think you just have to take...
you'd have to take some time

534
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,800
to build up the relationship.

535
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,360
[Christopher] I just like
the peace and quiet around here.

536
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,560
[burps] Oh, sorry.

537
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,440
[laughs]

538
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,480
No, actually, that came in the right,
the exact...

539
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,160
That actually came at the right moment.

540
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,520
[laughing]

541
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
You're welcome.

542
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,040
[squawking]

543
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,280
Do you want me to start, or...?

544
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,280
Um...

545
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,200
Sure.

546
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,960
I had fun.
And every word that I said to you,

547
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,360
and every word that I listened,
all of it was true.

548
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,920
You're a marvelous woman.

549
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,760
Oh, thank you.
I've never actually been told that before.

550
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,040
I could feel
that you were very genuine, yes.

551
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,520
But I don't see this going any further.

552
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,640
- [Olivia] Mmm.
- Not...

553
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,560
- Not really either, yeah.
- [Christopher] Mmm.

554
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,600
Not because of you or your faults.

555
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,600
No, seriously, look at me.

556
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,296
- I can't, the sun's in my eyes.
- Hang on.

557
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,560
- [laughing]
- How-how's that?

558
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
- How's... How's that?
- Yeah. [laughs]

559
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,840
Okay, there we go.

560
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,000
Nothing that you did has put me off.

561
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,360
It's just that whenever I try and look
for someone, I need to find a... spark.

562
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Okay.

563
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,200
Anything...

564
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
[Olivia] Ah.

565
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,640
Sorry...

566
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,440
- My jaw just clicked. Ah.
- Oh.

567
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,360
- I actually thought you were about to cry.
- No! My jaw clicked.

568
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,320
[laughs]

569
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,480
It's all right.

570
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
[laughs]

571
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Ah.

572
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,520
Well, I definitely want us
to meet again. So, uh...

573
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,360
- Do you want me to, or...?
- Uh...

574
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,320
Whatever you're comfortable with.

575
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,080
Handshake, or...?

576
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,320
Uh...

577
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,680
- Yeah, handshake.
- Okay.

578
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,560
I'm a huggy person,
but I don't know you that well, so...

579
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,320
- Fair enough, fair enough.
- [chuckles]

580
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Ah.

581
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,400
- All right. Well, thank you very much.
- You too.

582
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,960
- Look after yourself.
- I will.

583
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,240
[exhales]

584
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,360
[sighs]

585
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,080
[narrator] <i>Andrew has found out about</i>
<i>a speed dating event being held in town.</i>

586
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,880
<i>It's the first one to be hosted
by a local disability organization.</i>

587
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,456
- Good luck, darling.
- [Andrew] See ya.

588
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,920
- See you later.
- [Andrew] Bye.

589
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
[narrator] <i>For Andrew, tonight will be</i>
<i>his very first dating experience.</i>

590
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,400
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi.

591
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,136
- Milly.
- Milly, Andrew. Nice to meet you.

592
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Nice to meet you, Andrew.

593
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,160
I'm just gonna get you
to sign in real quick.

594
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,120
Yes, excellent.

595
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,240
I have had quite a lot of people
ask me for this event,

596
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,000
because people with these kinds
of differences or disabilities

597
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,640
find it really hard finding other people.

598
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,400
And so, we want everybody
to have the opportunity to fit in.

599
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,000
Thank you all so much
for coming this evening.

600
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,080
I know it's terrifying
and you're probably a bit nervous.

601
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,600
So, if you need any help,
feel free to just stick your hand up

602
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,720
or start screaming.

603
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,280
Whatever you want to do, that's fine.

604
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,736
There are a couple of things
on the table to help out.

605
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,880
So these are questions if you're having
trouble and want something to prompt.

606
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,200
The other thing there

607
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,160
is there are different questions
on each of the numbers.

608
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
So you can use the number cards,
or you can use these if you want.

609
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,920
If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

610
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,640
We're not here to judge,
we're just here to make friends.

611
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,680
[Andrew] Feeling a bit nervous, actually.

612
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,160
Yeah, just I don't want to make
a fool of myself,

613
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,600
don't want to embarrass myself.

614
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,960
Hi, I'm Andrew.

615
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,880
I'm Casey.

616
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,056
- Casey? Nice to meet you.
- Hi, yeah. Nice to meet you.

617
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,120
Yep.

618
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,440
So, um, have you got a job
at the moment, Casey?

619
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,120
Yes, I work at a...

620
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,840
like, the canteen café
at the Newcastle University.

621
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,440
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

622
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,640
Yeah. Are you still, um,
living with your parents

623
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,280
- or are you by yourself?
- Yeah. I am.

624
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,136
- Yeah. I still live with my parents...
- Okay.

625
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,040
...but I will be moving out
with my friend soon.

626
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,400
Oh, okay, yeah.

627
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm still living with my parents
at the moment, but...

628
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,160
- Yeah.
- [Andrew] Hmm.

629
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,200
Ah, pretty good.

630
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Um...

631
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,680
Any good questions? [chuckles]

632
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,720
No... I'm trying to, yeah,
find some good questions.

633
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,840
Um... [smacks lips]

634
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,880
Have you got a favorite movie?

635
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,760
Favorite movie. Um...

636
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,320
Movies done by M. Night Shyamalan.

637
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,040
<i>- Unbreakable, Glass,</i> and <i>Split.</i>
- Oh, yes. Um...

638
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,200
Yeah, I'm not really, uh,
fussed on those, actually.

639
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,120
- No?
- No.

640
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,800
- What movies do you like?
- Probably, um, James Bond,

641
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,520
um, maybe some of the old,
children's, um, movies,

642
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,840
like <i>Toy Story,</i>

643
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,400
<i>- The Lion King...</i>
- Oh, yeah. Gosh.

644
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,960
Those ones obviously everyone would like,
wouldn't they?

645
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,520
Ah, very good.

646
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
[mumbles softly]

[bell ringing]

649
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,760
Well, it's, um, nice meeting you.

650
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,720
- Yeah, it was nice meeting you, too.
- Yep.

651
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,720
- Hi.
- Hi.

652
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
I'm Andrew.

653
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,720
I'm Evie.

654
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,040
Hi, nice to meet you.

655
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,160
Nice... Yeah.

656
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,000
Uh...

657
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,360
So, tell me about yourself.

658
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,040
I like to bake cakes,

659
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,000
- Yep.
- I like watching anime...

660
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,280
- Yep.
- ...and I just am obsessed with animals.

661
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,760
Okay. Have you got a favorite animal?

662
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,880
Uh, wolves.

663
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,800
I wanted to work with wolves in Canada.

664
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Okay.

665
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,600
What about you? What do you do?

666
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,720
Um, family, I work actually.

667
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,480
I work for, uh,
Family and Community Services.

668
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,680
- Oh.
- So, it's a, um...

669
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,520
Yeah, a bit of data entry,
uh, stock control,

670
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,120
like, the stationery ordering
and that, yeah.

671
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,040
Um, I need those cards, actually.

672
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,680
Sorry, I'm not really good at talking.

673
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,280
No, no, no, it's okay. I figure we've done
all the good ones, so, um...

674
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Yep.

675
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Uh, let's see. Um...

676
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Ah, no...

677
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,840
If your life was a movie,
which celebrity would you play?

678
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,600
Ah, Kate Hutchins.

679
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
I love her.

680
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,800
Okay...

681
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,120
- Oh, yes, now I know who she is. That...
- Yes.

682
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,800
Yeah, um, I don't mind. Um...

683
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,080
Have you heard of, uh, Pierce Brosnan?
Um, James Bond?

684
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,800
- Yeah.
- Yes, he's my favorite,

685
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,400
um, actor, actually.

686
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,320
Um, yeah.

687
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,560
Yeah, do you have a favorite movie?

688
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,680
- <i>Toy Story. </i>[laughs]
<i>- Toy Story?</i>

689
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,120
I know it's childish.

690
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,040
No, no, no, that's okay.
I don't mind <i>Toy Story</i> as well.

691
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,480
Like, all the children's, um, shows,

692
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,960
- like <i>The Lion King, Toy Story...</i>
- Yeah.

693
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,080
- Like the old versions, not the new ones.
- No, no.

694
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,120
'Cause the new ones
are kind of stuffed up.

695
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,600
Yeah. I think probably <i>Toy Story</i>
and <i>Toy Story 2</i>

696
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,000
- would probably be my best, yeah.
- [bell ringing]

697
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,920
- Well, it's nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

698
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,160
- See you again.
- See ya!

699
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,320
[narrator] <i>At the end of the event,</i>

700
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,360
<i>Andrew has chosen
who he would like to see again.</i>

701
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,600
<i>He will only be put in touch
if the other person also chooses him.</i>

702
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,440
I'm actually leaning towards, uh, Evie,

703
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,760
because I could see she was a nice girl,

704
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,680
um, beautiful,

705
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,160
um, her hair was good...

706
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,880
[Cian] You've just gotta hope
she chooses you too, hey?

707
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Yes.

708
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,560
So, fingers crossed. Yep.

709
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,920
- Hey...
- Oh, are you heading off?

710
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,880
Yeah, I'm heading off.

711
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,680
So, it was very nice to meet you.

712
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,280
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I'm really awkward with people.

713
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
No, that's all right.

714
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,320
It's your first time with me,
you're a bit nervous and that, yeah.

715
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,280
But nice meeting you. See ya Jared!

716
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,480
- See ya!
- [Andrew] Yep.

717
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,240
[knocking]

718
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Hello.

719
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,640
[Cian] How you doing?

720
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,760
Good.

721
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,680
I'm excited. Nervous, excited.

722
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,280
- [Cian] Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

723
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,440
[Cian] In a good way?

724
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Yeah.

725
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,040
It's different than last time.
I feel more prepared than last time.

726

[grunts]

727
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
I am going to wear...

728
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,400
this, and this...

729
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,240
and those shoes.

- Hi.

I'm Thomas. [chuckles]

Do you have an accent?

I like to think I've got

749
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,480
[Olivia] Oh.

750
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,120
From all the, uh, video games
and movies I watch.

751
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,240
I've got a bit of Polish blood in me.

752
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,400
- [laughs]
- Oh, nice.

753
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,600
What do you like to do for fun?

754
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,760
Play video games.

755
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,080
- Likewise. [laughs]
- Yes.

756
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,936
- [tires screeching]
- I don't know about you,

757
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
but I'm sensitive
to sounds and smells...

758
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,160
Not smells, but sounds.

759
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,400
Sounds? Oh, yeah.

760
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,880
And so, sometimes,
when it comes to certain...

761
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,880
- abrupt sounds [snaps fingers] or...
- Yes.

762
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,440
...odors, if you will...

763
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,120
I just, like... I'm like, "Okay, I'm out.

764
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,840
Nope, I'm gone." [laughs]

765
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
- Oh, hey.
- [Thomas] Oh!

766
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,160
I thought it'd better to go the soft-drink
route rather than the alcohol route.

767
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,776
- I don't drink, so that's all right.
- That's all right, we'll...

768
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,040
We shall enjoy our fine beverages.

769
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,920
It's orange, like my hair.

770
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,760
How long do you have to spend
with your hair?

771
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,160
Because it looks quite lovely.

772
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
I didn't do anything today,
I just brushed it.

773
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,520
- Really? Ah.
- [Olivia] Yes.

774
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,200
See, for me,
I... I go through a vigorous schedule.

775
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,720
I get mousse,

776
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,160
I stylize it,

777
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,200
and then I get, uh, my comb

778
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,320
and I roll it through,

779
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,040
and then I get some hair fiber
and put it through.

780
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,120
Huh? Sorry, I zoned out. Sorry, my bad.

781
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,640
Oh, that's okay, I zone out too.

782
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,440
So, you said you had a movement disorder?

783
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,280
I think one of my, um, students
on the spectrum has that as well.

784
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,640
No, they don't. I guarantee they don't.

785
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,520
Because no one in this world
knows what it is.

786
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
- [farts]
- Really?

787
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,680
[laughs]

788
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,200
Happens to the best of us.

789
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,480
[both laugh]

790
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
[Olivia] Oh!

791
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,520
- [laughing]
- It's all good.

792
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,920
- It was going so well.
- [both laugh]

793
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,880
That's okay. I... I've already...
I've forgotten it already.

794
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,000
[laughs]

795
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,120
I'm a big fan of voluminous hair,
and she had volume.

796
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,880
And I was like, wow, that's great to see.

797
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,360
Uh, then when we started talking,

798
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,360
and I noticed that she was
as lively as I was,

799
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,720
it's always great to meet someone
who shares your...

800
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,840
types of, you know, engagement.

801
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,080
It's always hard to speak with someone
who is, you know, very shut off.

802
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,120
- Shall we get out of here?
- [Olivia] Yes.

803
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,600
Awesome. I know just a...
A nice little walk along the weir.

804
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,640
And I've got a little surprise for you,
too, okay?

805
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,560
Oh, I'm scared now!

806
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,680
Oh, no, don't worry. Nothing's gonna
come out of the bushes or whatever.

807
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,960
- [laughs]
- [Thomas chuckles]

808
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,200
Did you want me
to put the jumper on for you?

809
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,640
- [Olivia] Yes.
- [Thomas] Awesome.

810
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,240
There you go.

811
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,280
Yeah, just a generally nice person
to be around and...

812
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,040
quite... quite chatty.

813
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,896
I think I've just discovered
what it's like to hear myself for an hour.

814
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,880
[laughs]

815
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,480
- Oh, this is nice.
- Yeah.

816
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,000
Uh, do you go for many walks
along the water?

817
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,240
No, but I always say I'm gonna do it,
but I never do. I need to do it more.

818
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Yeah.

819
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,720
So, I thought a little bit
of a moonlight dance would be nice.

820
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,600
[laughs]

821
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,040
[romantic music plays]

822
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,320
[Olivia] Oh, I can't remember
what this dance was...

823
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,720
I'm not quite sure either.

824
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
[both laugh]

825
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
[Thomas laughs]

826
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,360
Something wrong?

827
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,736
Please don't do that.
You're making fun of my disability.

828
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,840
No, I wasn't doing that. Sorry.

829
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,480
I was actually dancing
to the, uh... the beat.

830
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,040
- [dog barks]
- That's all. I...

831
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,040
- I... I'm sorry it came off like that.
- [laughs]

832
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,360
I didn't mean to do it.

833
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
That's all right.

834
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,800
I got to ask,
how did you feel tonight went?

835
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Um...

836
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,560
[sighs]

837
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,480
You can give me your honest opinion.

838
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,680
It's not that...
You know, I... I can take it.

839
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,800
[laughs]

840
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Ah...

841
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,200
I think we got along pretty well.

842
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,840
We did, yeah.

843
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,800
If you want, um,

844
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,560
we could catch up, maybe in the city?

845
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Uh...

846
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,880
I'd like to talk online first for a while.

847
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,640
That sounds like a good idea.

848
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,120
Very amicable suggestion, indeed.

849
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,040
Well, it was a pleasure to, uh, meet you.

850
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
I'll see you around.

851
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,240
- Yep.
- Bye.

852
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Bye.

853
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,520
[Cian] In your family,
you feel like you're the only one

854
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,880
who's still struggling to find someone.

855
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,800
That's it.

856
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,800
It feels, uh, sad,

857
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,160
uh, a bit upset...

858
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,840
Because I want to actually
start my own family, um,

859
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,160
um, as soon as possible, and that.

860
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,040
[Cian] So you feel
you're running out of time?

861
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Yes.

862
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
Still nothing.

863
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,640
[narrator] <i>It's the morning</i>
<i>after speed dating,</i>

864
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,720
<i>and Andrew is keen to hear
if he has a match.</i>

865
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
[phone chimes]

866
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,200
"Hi, Andrew.

867
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,360
Thank you for attending
our Sen speed dating.

868
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,120
Your matches for the evening
are as follows:

869
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Evie.

870
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,120
The next step is up to you."

871
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,160
[Cian] So that's good news.

872
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,960
Yes, excellent.

873
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,016
- [Cian] How do you feel about that?
- Very excited.

874
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,000
Actually, very pleased with myself.

875
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
[Cian] Well done.

876
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,680
- Thank you.
- High five!
