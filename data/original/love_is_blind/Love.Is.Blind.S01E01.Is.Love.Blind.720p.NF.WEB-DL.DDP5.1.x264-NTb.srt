4
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,315
When I heard about
this experiment, I knew it was for me.

5
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,610
It was the opposite of
what modern dating has become.

6
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,196
There's so many dating apps,

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,033
and most of them are based off of
your physical appearance.

8
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,994
It's not all about
physical attraction, in the long run.

9
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,371
It's who's holding your hand
on your deathbed.

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,684
The reason I came here is

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,711
there's men who actually want to
get married, they want commitment.

12
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,171
They're looking for wives.

13
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,672
I'm like, "What? Where?"

14

- Wow.
- Hi!

20
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:13,948
I'm Briana!

21
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,702
I really want a man
who is going to love me for me.

22
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,122
Not what I look like,
but for who I am on the inside.

23
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,624
When we're 95 years old,

24
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,834
my boobs might be, like,
dragging on the floor,

25
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,961
but I need you to love my saggy boobs.

26
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,588
That was real extra,

27
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,091
but that's really how I feel.

28
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,804
Oh, shit.

29
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,889
This is dope. Oh, man!

30
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,852
I'm short, and there are women out there
that won't date guys that are shorter.

31
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,853
Westley.

32
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,064
It's a bummer, but being in this facility,

33
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,316
we're really getting down to
what matters most.

34
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,320
Growing up,
I wanted to be like Hugh Hefner,

35
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,656
a stylish guy
who can have his pick of the litter.

36
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,534
But there comes a time in every man's life

37
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,286
where he has to settle down.

38
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,955
I'm so ready to find a wife.

39
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,617
Oh, my gosh, you guys!

40
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,920
- Hi!
- Hey, hey!

41
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,797
Oh, my God!

42
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,632
- Hi!
- Hi!

43
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,716
How you guys doing?

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,761
- Freaking out a little bit!
- Yeah? Welcome.

45
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,221
I'm Vanessa Lachey.

46
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,723
I'm obviously Nick Lachey, her husband.

47
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,184
Ladies,
welcome to the blind love experiment.

48
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,023
Here, you will choose someone to marry...

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,487
without ever seeing them.

50
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,326
We live in such a disconnected
and distracted world.

51
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,081
Your value is often judged
solely by the photo on your dating app.

52
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,085
- Mm-hmm.
- True. That's true.

53
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,169
But everyone wants to be loved

54
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,252
for who they are.

55
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,297
Not for their looks, their race,

56
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,382
their background or their income.

57
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,884
- Right.
- So true.

58
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,636
Psychologists believe that
emotional connection

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,513
is the key to long-term marital success...

60
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,308
<i>not</i> physical attraction.

61
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,641
So here,

62
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,479
your relationships will begin
by forging an intimate bond,

63
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,273
with nothing to distract you.

64
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,608
Here's how it's going to work.

65
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,320
Over the next ten days, ladies,
you're going to live on this side,

66
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,655
and the men will live on the other side.

67
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,576
You're going to speak to
a stream of potential love interests.

68
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,994
But here's the catch.

69
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,871
Looks won't play a factor.

70
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,207
We've taken away your devices.

71
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,751
The only time
you're going to interact

72
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,878
is in one of the private pods.

73
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,969
You're going to be separated by
one thin wall.

74
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,139
You won't ever get to see each other.

75
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,896
Ultimately, all decisions are yours.

76
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,523
You can choose who you want to
spend time with.

77
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,319
Once you choose the person you want to
spend the rest of your life with,

78
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,029
- you'll propose.
- Just like that?

79
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,406
If they accept,

80
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,700
you will finally get to see your fiancée

81
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,410
for the very first time.

82
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,122
You're going to leave here together

83
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,749
as an engaged couple

84
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,959
with a wedding date.

85
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,378
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my God.

86
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,214
You'll move in together,
see your family and friends,

87
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,258
and in just four weeks,

88
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,926
you'll be at your wedding.

89
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,343
I just got goosebumps.

90
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,264
Is this registering for other people?

91
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,683
This is arguably the biggest decision

92
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
you'll ever make in life.

93
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,103
Will you say "I do"

94
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,731
to the person that you've chosen
right here, sight unseen?

95
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,444
Or will physical realities
in the real world sabotage you,

96
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,240
and will you walk away from them forever?

97
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,660
This literally is the first time
an experiment like this

98
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,035
has ever been done.

99
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,331
We all have to remember
the central question:

100
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,167
Is love truly blind?

101
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,295
We hope so.

102
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,049
If you're ready to find
the love of your life,

103
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,677
then walk through those doors,

104
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,055
because the pods are now open.

105
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,349
I'm going first!

106
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,351
If I fall in love and get engaged,

107
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,312
it will be with someone I've never seen.

108
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,396
It's crazy.

109
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,606
- It's go time.
- Whoo!

110
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm gonna go on
a series of speed dates,

111
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,536
and find my king,

112
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,204
because I'm the queen,

113
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,291
and he might be on the other side
of the wall, if I'm lucky.

114
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,795
The only weird part is that some of these
women might be trying to get my husband.

115
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,341
Basically I'm going to be
blind dating all these women.

116
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,301
- It's game time.
- Game time.

117
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,844
Get that wife, get that wife.

118
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,554
They can't see how fly I am,

119
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,077
they can't say, "Oh, he's handsome."

120
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,100
They can't say,
"Oh, I like chocolate skin and beards."

121
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,478
They have to rely on my personality.

122
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,480
It's literally blind love.

123
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,147
Good luck.

124
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,984
Hello?

125
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,111
Hello?

126
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,071
Hello?

127
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,072
Hello, hello!

128
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,698
Oh, wow!

129
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,367
These rooms are nice!

130
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,701
Hello?

131
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,619
Noiseproof.

132
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,329
Welcome to my pod.

133
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,454
Yeah!

134
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,499
Nice to hear from you.

135
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,185
- Right?
- I can't say "see you."

136
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,502
What are you looking at?

137
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,420
It looks like a scene from <i>Frozen.</i>

138
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,565
I'm going straight for the candy
over here right now.

139
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,716
Uh, I might go for the vodka,
to be honest.

140
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,470
- Can you see anything?
- No.

141
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,118
There's nothing happening?

142
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,014
Nothing.

143
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,391
My name is Jessica Baton,

144
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,059
I'm from Rock Falls, Illinois.

145
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,145
I've had a rigid set of standards.

146
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,024
I would only date a guy
between one to five years older.

147
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,486
I would only date athletes,
because I'm really athletic.

148
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,738
But I'm 34 years old,

149
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,156
and I may not find someone

150
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,576
based on the criteria
that I've put in place for myself.

151
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,954
I'm ready to start a family,

152
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:57,125
and I want to have
the most perfect marriage.

153
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,061
- What's your name?
- I'm Jessica.

154
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,920
Nice to meet you, Jessica.
I'm Mark.

155
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,672
Nice to meet you, Mark.

156
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,674
Well, let's just get right down to it!

157
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,052
Tell me about your family.

158
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,555
Both my parents are immigrants.
They both came from Mexico.

159
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,598
And I'm a mama's boy.

160
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,853
Okay! I'll make a note of that!

161
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,688
My grandma had 15 kids.

162
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,523
- You're kidding me?
- Swear.

163
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,286
- You know what I'm saying?
- That's crazy.

164
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,195
I'm Mark Cuevas, I'm 24 years old,
and I'm from Chicago, Illinois.

165
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,934
Both my parents are from Mexico.

166
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,992
I'll never forget my first date
with one of my girlfriends in high school.

167
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,785
She had told her dad that I was Mexican,

168
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,269
and he opened the door and he goes,

169
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,746
"Oh, you're not what I expected."

170
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,332
And that's why I love this experiment,

171
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,668
because it lets you really dig deep

172
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,629
on who someone really is,
and not worry about what they look like.

173
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,131
So, I'm 24.

174
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,258
- I'm 34.
- Okay.

175
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,181
I never dated anyone
younger than me.

176
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,260
- Really?
- I think every relationship is different

177
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,389
and you have to take things as they come.

178
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,141
I feel that. Where you from?

179
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,761
I'm from Illinois.

180
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,644
- Me, too. What part?
- You're kidding?

181
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,938
I'm from two hours west of Chicago.

182
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,857
- Go Cubbies!
- I was about to say,

183
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,650
"Oh, my God, she's a Cubs fan!"

184
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,694
Huge Cubs fan, huge Bears fan.

185
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,613
I'm a Bears fan till I die.

186
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,823
Every Sunday, I dress up my dog.

187
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,408
Her name is Payton Hester.

188
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,118
No freaking way!

189
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,962
I dress her
in her Payton jersey...

190
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,415
...and we watch the Bears.

191
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,375
You know what?
I make the best Italian beef.

192
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,336
- Seriously?
- Oh! It's like...

193
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,963
I'm starring your name with "Italian..."

194
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,674
No, literally,
my Italian beef is the best.

195
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,635
I'm smiling.
I don't know if you can tell.

196
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,720
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so happy you're here.

197
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,803
This is awesome.

198
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,991
I came in here
open to doing this experiment,

199
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,391
but I really didn't think that

200
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,560
I would connect with someone
off the bat like that,

201
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,063
and with Mark it was just instant.

202
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,690
We're different race, we're different age,

203
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,443
but we're definitely
cut from the same cloth.

204
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,861
Bro,

205
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,112
that was awesome!

206
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,912
It's fun meeting
so many different men

207
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,956
who are ready to get married.

208
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,085
The quality of men is excellent.

209
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,549
My name is Lauren Speed, and I'm 32.

210
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,551
I am originally from Detroit.

211
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,512
My mom calls me at least once a week

212
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,597
and reminds me that my eggs
are shriveling up.

213
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,723
Like, no lie.

214
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:22,103
I'm just really ready for my husband, and
I know that he's out there looking for me,

215
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,374
and it's time for us to find each other
and quit playing these games, okay?

216
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,398
It's time.

217
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,317
- Hello?
- Hello.

218
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,944
- I'm Lauren.
- I'm Cameron.

219
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,696
Where are you from, Cameron?

220
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,322
I'm from the state of Maine.

221
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,825
I don't think I've met anyone
from Maine before.

222
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,702
I'm the only one you'll ever need to meet.

223
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,162
I like that. I like that.

224
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,832
What kind of work do you do?

225
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,625
I work in artificial intelligence.

226
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,045
When you say "artificial intelligence,"
I think about building robots and...

227
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,464
Yeah, I'm basically taking over the world.

228
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,258
That's awesome.

229
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,884
My name is Cameron Hamilton.

230
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,387
I'm 28, and I'm from Lee, Maine.

231
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,889
I always hear,
"You don't look like a scientist,"

232
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,142
which is kind of a funny thing because,

233
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,102
like, what does a scientist
really look like?

234
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,146
But, as a scientist,

235
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,398
I'm a believer in this experiment

236
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,651
that's removing the confounding variables

237
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,778
of ethnicity, race,

238
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,157
background, and the big one
being physical appearance.

239
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,075
None of that matters.

240
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,496
Would you say
that you're an introvert or an extrovert?

241
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,707
I think I'm more naturally introverted,

242
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,376
but I can be extroverted
when I need to be.

243
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,003
- Okay.
- How about yourself?

244
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,047
I think I'm a combination
of the two.

245
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,050
When I am around other people,
I'm totally on,

246
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,136
but there are times when I'm like,
I just want to sit at home

247
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,889
watch movies and chill, and drink wine...

248
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,992
- I couldn't agree more.
- ...and eat food.

249
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,392
Yeah! Do you cook?

250
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,603
- I do cook.
- Okay.

251
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,980
Would you make if we were on a date?

252
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,316
Mm, I would probably make either salmon,

253
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,320
- or I would make some <i>peri </i>chicken, rice.
- Oh, yes.

254
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,405
- There we go. Now we're talking.
- Yeah.

255
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,032
- Do you cook?
- Yeah, I do cook.

256
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,042
- I like a man who can cook.
- Yeah?

257
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,679
- Yeah. That's 'cause I like to eat.
- I can cook for you.

258
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,455
- So that's great.
- Yeah.

259
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:10,044
It's definitely interesting not seeing
the man on the other side of the glass.

260
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,006
They really have to get to know me
and my tone and my personality

261
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,009
outside of, "Oh, she's cute,
her breasts look good."

262
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,553
What are you really looking for
in a partner?

263
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,557
Somebody who is supportive,
someone who's loving.

264
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,978
I like when a guy hugs me from behind
and makes me feel, like, small.

265
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,939
Yeah, that's good.

266
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,736
- Gosh, I want to get to know you more.
- I know, I like you.

267
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,986
I like you, too.

268
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,740
I like your voice, too. You sound cute.

269
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,704
When am I going to see you again?

270
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,122
Soon as possible?

271
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,794
- I'll talk to you soon, Lauren.
- Bye, Cameron.

272
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,874
Bye.

273
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,463
My connection with Cameron
is very strong,

274
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,507
and I feel like I'm a good
judge of character,

275
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,051
so I'm feeling more comfortable.

276
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,596
I'm feeling ready to
just continue with this experiment

277
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,808
and just meet more men.

278
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,686
How's it going?

279
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,769
Hello.

280
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,354
Hello, hello.

281
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,689
Hi.

282
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,316
- Hello!
- Hi!

283
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,662
So, what are some of your
biggest turn-offs?

284
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,862
- Turn-<i>offs?
- </i>Mm-hmm.

285
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,032
Oh, my God. I hate, I hate, I hate

286
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,659
being able to hear people breathe.

287
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,662
What are you looking for in a woman?

288
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,830
In shape,

289
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,040
and beautiful.

290
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,042
Oh, that doesn't sound shallow at all.

291
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,920
If I had to guess,
I'd say you're African-American.

292
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,567
This is our first talk and you're already
asking me what I look like?

293
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,592
You're missing the point!

294
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,719
What makes you think I'm African-American?

295
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,845
Just your voice.

296
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,555
Who cares what my complexion is?

297
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,557
I'm a woman,
that's all you need to worry about,

298
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,058
that I don't have a penis.

299
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,436
- Actually, no, I'm white.
- Are you?

300
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,024
I've only dated black men before,

301
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:59,028
but honestly, I'm the type of person
that I am attracted to personality.

302
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,280
Not saying I want to marry Shrek
or anything like that,

303
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,199
but if Shrek had a good personality,
I mean...

304
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,496
My name is Amber Pike. I am 26,

305
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,164
and I'm from Augusta, Georgia.

306
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,583
A lot of people don't take me seriously
because...

307
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,211
I ain't ugly, so...

308
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,838
And I've actually had
a few people tell me that

309
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,341
they were pleasantly surprised
when they found out that

310
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,010
I can hold an intellectual conversation.

311
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,263
They're really shocked when they find out
there's more to me than looking cute.

312
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,226
Oh, God.

313
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,393
Hi.

314
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,788
Hey. Oh, God.

315
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,063
I didn't know you were in here!

316
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,251
- Nice snort.
- God dang it.

317
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,362
I've got to stop doing that!
I told myself I wasn't gonna do that

318
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,113
until the second or third date.

319
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,237
- Well, it's cute, so...
- Well, thank you.

320
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,402
My name is Barnett.

321
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,954
I'm 27 years old,
and I live in Canton, Georgia.

322
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,248
I'm excited to get to know someone

323
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,125
based off of getting deep
and down and dirty

324
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,169
with them, emotionally.

325
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,629
I'm Barnett.

326
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,774
- Is that your first name or your last?
- My last name.

327
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,925
But my real close friends call me that.

328
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,552
A lot of friends call me Pike.

329
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,221
It's kind of an army thing,
but they also did it in cheerleading.

330
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,014
Okay, so you're in the army?

331
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,617
- I was.
- And you were a cheerleader?

332
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,644
I enlisted in the Georgia Army Guard
when I was 17.

333
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,729
- I did eight years.
- Oh, wow.

334
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,857
I'm so used to, like,
running with the boys.

335
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,400
Like, I'm just so...

336
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,152
off-the-wall crazy sometimes.

337
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,611
Oh, gosh.

338
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,781
Yeah, so...

339
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,025
I always go for pretty girls.

340
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,869
It's shallow to say, but it's the truth.

341
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,432
I'm hoping this leads to something...

342
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,913
more real,

343
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,540
but this is different.

344
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,419
I have no clue what any of them look like,
so I'm like...

345
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,214
I'm nervous, but I like talking, so...

346
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,091
Do you want kids, Barnett?

347
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,319
- Do I have kids?
- Do you <i>want </i>kids?

348
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,261
Oh, yeah, I do, but...

349
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,554
Wait, do you have kids?

350
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,477
- That's a question, too.
- Not that I know of.

351
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,474
I mean...

352
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,059
I like it! Okay, okay.

353
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,229
In the dating pod, I'm trying to see
if they hang with my jokes

354
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,106
and my personality.

355
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,816
Are you clumsy?

356
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,902
Generally, no. Lately, yes.

357
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,403
What about in bed?

358
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,780
Well, I ain't timid, that's for sure.

359
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,074
I've never had sex.

360
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,951
That's unfortunate. Next!

361
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,830
The hardest part is
not being able to see facial expressions.

362
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,333
So I'm going to come off creepy
to some of them, probably.

363
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,959
Hello.

364
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:19,960
Hey.

365
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,171
So, what's your name?

366
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,190
- I'm Jessica, what's yours?
- "Jessica."

367
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,549
My name is Barnett.

368
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,633
I like it.

369
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,095
All right, so I'm a big weirdo.
What's the weirdest thing about you?

370
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,847
Oh, I like this.

371
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,600
Like, you would look at me and think

372
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,310
that I would be...

373
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,061
really girly,

374
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,356
which I have that side of myself,
for sure,

375
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,650
but I actually dig sports

376
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,277
and I definitely couldn't date a dude
that wasn't into sports.

377
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,405
- Ew. I hate sports.
- You do not.

378
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,699
I'm kidding.
I played baseball my whole life.

379
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,368
- Oh, cool!
- So, yeah.

380
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,204
- What position?
- Like, what's my favorite position?

381
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,958
Is that what you asked? I'm just kidding.

382
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,417
I was a pitcher.

383
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,503
That was amazing! I love that.

384
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,129
So, you're witty.

385
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,674
Alright, I see you.

386
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,300
I see you over there.

387
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,761
I have a serious question for you
around intimacy.

388
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,845
Ooh, yeah.

389
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,181
What do you think about...

390
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,100
dogs in the bed?

391
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,979
I am one, but... No, I'm kidding.

392
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,438
Oh, my God!

393
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,483
My dog sleeps with me
every night, so...

394
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,710
- Really?
- Yeah.

395
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,735
I love that. Mine, too.

396
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,445
Well, I'm just... I'm a big cuddler

397
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,590
- and she knows it, so she just like...
- I love that.

398
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,949
Are you the big or little?

399
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,658
What do you think?

400
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,909
Probably the big.

401
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,954
- Nope.
- You're the little spoon?

402
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,915
Your dog is just draped over you?

403
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,319
- I'm getting a mental picture.
- She puts a paw around me.

404
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:49,466
I like Barnett's sexy voice and laugh
a lot.

405
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,303
I kind of like that he gave off a vibe
that he was a player.

406
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,724
We weren't necessarily getting deep,

407
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,226
but there's an organic chemistry there.

408
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,771
- It was nice talking to you.
- It was nice talking to you, too.

409
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,982
There was some good voices.

410
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,317
I think Jessica had a nice voice.

411
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,902
That's probably the sexiest.

412
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,779
All these girls love my jokes,

413
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,114
every single one of them.

414
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,824
You know, "Oh, next one laughed.

415
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,451
There's my wife. All right."

416
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,537
It's like whoever I saw last
is my number one.

417
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,003
I've been going on date after date.

418
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,422
I have absolutely experienced
some instant connections,

419
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,508
and my goal is to find out

420
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,260
if there are any red flags,

421
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,431
any deal breakers
that are on my side or on her side.

422
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,599
Have you ever had a dog?

423
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,768
- I personally have not owned a dog.
- Okay.

424
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,935
Does that rule me out?

425
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,980
No, as long as you would never
yell at a dog.

426
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:45,939
Who does that?

427
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,233
Uh... People.

428
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,110
You know, I'm here to find love,

429
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,863
and it's going to take more than
talking about dogs to do that.

430
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,907
Jeez, I sound like an asshole.

431
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,326
- What's your name?
- My name is Diamond.

432
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,536
Diamond? Okay.
How you doing, Diamond?

433
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,347
- That's my real name.
- I was gonna...

434
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,874
I heard it in your voice, questioning it.

435
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,086
So, which strip club do you work at?
I'm kidding!

436
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,002
You know what?

437
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,670
I knew you were going to say that.

438
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,006
You're trying to lose points. Look, "-5."

439
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,175
Hell, no! Barnett, uh-uh.

440
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,593
Keep moving.

441
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,805
A lot of girls will develop daddy issues
in the form of,

442
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,640
"I need a man's attention."

443
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,558
Instead of turning into that,

444
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,311
I became my own
masculine influence in my life,

445
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,856
I was a big tomboy,
like, I wanted to work on cars.

446
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,862
I wanted to build things
and make things with my hands.

447
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,280
I wanted to be a bad-ass.

448
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,031
Hello?

449
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,371
Oh, my God.

450
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,164
That was so strange
and awesome.

451
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,833
Oh, my God.

452
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,167
Who are y'all feeling?

453
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,379
None of them,
because it was through a wall.

454
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,047
I totally have a favorite.

455
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,549
Favorite, favorite, favorite.

456
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,926
You don't want to compare favorites?
I had one guy...

457
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,386
What if we have the same favorite?

458
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,512
I'm gonna fight you.

459
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,430
My favorite was Barnett.

460
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,142
He made me laugh so much.

461
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,396
He's really sarcastic and perverted,
and I'm like, yo...

462
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,897
That's me, friends!

463
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,693
Like, once you figure out who they are
and who they are on the inside,

464
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,921
do you feel like it doesn't matter
what they look like?

465
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,656
I feel like once you get to know someone,
though, on that level,

466
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,658
then they are more attractive to you.

467
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,451
- Yes. I agree.
- Yes. Yeah.

468
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,662
Before coming here for this experience,

469
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,707
I definitely judged a book by its cover.

470
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,918
It was definitely based on
a physical attraction first.

471
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,005
I probably sound crazy saying this,
but in less than 24 hours,

472
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,298
I have found, like,

473
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,592
honestly, probably three potential guys

474
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,303
that I can see myself with
for the rest of my life.

475
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,013
Is anyone a virgin here?

476
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,390
'Cause, like, somebody asked me that.

477
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,060
Really?

478
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,688
- Are you a virgin?
- I am.

479
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,190
- Really?
- Yeah. I am.

480
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,107
Wow.

481
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,775
So, how soon is too soon?

482
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,944
If right here says now,

483
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,668
- and says the same to her...
- Sometimes right here is right here.

484
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,240
My God.

485
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,118
Every girl grows up
waiting for their Prince Charming,

486
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,163
and I want to make sure that
this is it, that this is the one,

487
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,207
and I'm willing to wait for it.

488
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:12,586
What's the most times that you guys
have had sex in one day or night?

489
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,087
I would say four.

490
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,464
Dang!

491
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,341
- Is that a lot?
- Lillie Mae!

492
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,968
You wasn't in pain?

493
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,682
Do you guys think it's important
to go there sexually with someone

494
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,934
before you marry her?

495
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,727
That's a tough one.

496
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,938
- That's the rest your life.
- Yeah.

497
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,272
Yeah.

498
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,775
When it comes to marriage,
a great sex life is important.

499
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,069
I expect to be pleased as a man,

500
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,154
and I expect to please her.

501
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:44,701
But here, I'm trying to choose the person
that I will spend the rest of my life with

502
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,204
without even knowing
what this person looks like.

503
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,122
That's absolutely crazy.

504
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,335
Does size matter,
or is it the motion in the ocean?

505
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,420
It's the size that matters,

506
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,632
because there's no motion in any ocean

507
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,593
without the thing
that makes the motion go.

508
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,096
- If it's very tiny...
- Oh, my gosh.

509
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,098
Why does it have to be <i>very </i>tiny?

510
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,182
Like, damn!

511
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,394
Very, very tiny, or...

512
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,356
- Goodness Lord.
- Oh, my gosh.

513
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,526
What kind of traumatic experiences
have you had?

514
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,902
You've got to check it.

515
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,905
You've got to put the snake
back in the cage.

516
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,157
Put it back in the case.

517
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,579
<i>♪ We are golden
Yes we are ♪</i>

518
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,709
<i>♪ Hear the thunder
See the stars ♪</i>

519
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,770
I wonder how the guys
are doing.

520
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,214
Wait, what do guys do
when they can't play video games?

521
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,550
"Yo, bro, I bet I can do
more push-ups than you."

522
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,302
- "Go, bro."
- Oh, my God.

523
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,678
Fifteen, 16...

524
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:48,598
- Breathe!
- ...17, 18, 19, 20.

525
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,142
I can see that back just going...

526
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,020
Now that you're all tired on that,
now let's do a push-up competition.

527
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,730
Yeah, I'll do it.

528
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,981
My name is Carlton Morton.

529
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,234
I'm 34 years old,
and I'm from Opelousas, Louisiana.

530
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,487
I had a good night's sleep,

531
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,864
I'm ready to date,

532
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,616
and it's time to start narrowing it down.

533
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,826
Hello?

534
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,952
Hey!

535
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,116
You sound happy.

536
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,205
I wish I could get
that type of greeting every day.

537
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,375
No, I'm just... You're so funny.

538
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,877
I kid with you.

539
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,797
So I want to know, what are some things
that stand out about me to you?

540
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,717
I wrote my notes down.
I'm gonna get them out.

541
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,634
Okay.

542
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,138
Your personality's really good,
you have morals and values.

543
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,849
Love that you love to travel,
'cause I love to travel as well.

544
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,944
You know
I've never been to Vegas?

545
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,228
- You've never been to Vegas?
- Never.

546
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,858
I can't wait to have that Vegas moment
where I'm standing on tables, partying.

547
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,188
I see where you're going to
have your bachelor party.

548
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,403
If you'll let me.

549
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,030
Oh! What you mean, if I let you?

550
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:49,493
Look, I've waited for the moment
to fall in love for so long

551
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,119
that I'm not messing nothing up.

552
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,746
I am Diamond Jack,

553
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,625
I am 28 years old,
and I am from Chicago, Illinois.

554
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,504
I know I am an attractive female,
and I get a lot of attention from guys.

555
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,841
Being a professional dancer,
it has led to some ups and downs,

556
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,009
especially in dating.

557
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,763
There have been guys out there
who only want to talk to me for my looks,

558
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,046
or only want to talk to me
because of what I do in life,

559
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,143
and I want to be with someone
who is going to really get to know me

560
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,062
for who I am because, honestly,

561
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,732
my mom didn't name me Diamond for nothing,
she named me Diamond for a reason.

562
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,609
That's the thing with relationships,

563
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,152
you have to be able to trust.

564
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,073
You're a totally different type of woman,
and I appreciate that about you.

565
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,742
If you were like,
"No, I don't want you to go to Vegas,

566
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,285
'cause last time this happened,

567
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,721
- I don't feel comfortable."
- No, no, no.

568
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,414
That's another thing about relationships:

569
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,374
What's in the past
needs to stay in the past.

570
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,292
I'm not your ex-girl

571
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,087
- who mistreated you or cheated on you.
- Yeah.

572
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,570
I'm a different person.
I'm Diamond.

573
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,550
I will want my king to have fun,
live your life.

574
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,343
- I like that.
- So, go to Vegas,

575
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,928
and tell me all about it!

576
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,264
I feel like there's chemistry
with Diamond.

577
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,307
The way she talks to me,

578
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,226
the way she makes me smile.

579
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,523
I am so anxious to dive deeper in
to see if she's the one.

580
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,462
Would you want to go on another date?

581
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,277
I will want to go on
another date with you.

582
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,571
You're trying to put on
your sexy voice right now.

583
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,074
I'm not!

584
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,294
There are so many girls
that I'm talking to,

585
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:27,007
but Jessica and I
have that emotional, strong bond.

586
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,844
I would say you're the conversation
I look forward to most.

587
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,929
- Same. I...
- You swear?

588
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,055
Yeah, I promise you.

589
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,683
Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

590
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,607
I'm making so many connections
with all the women that I'm talking to.

591
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,442
Oh, yeah. What's up, LC?

592
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,194
- What's up?
- What's up, girl?

593
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,739
The person that I talked to
that was the coolest was you.

594
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,990
I love that.

595
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,202
- I had so much fun talking to you.
- You're going to love me after this.

596
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,581
It's weird how, like,
these girls are fluctuating in my head.

597
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,625
- Hello.
- Hey, Barnett, it's Amber.

598
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,835
Amber's scary. I really like her.

599
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,880
I really like talking to her,
but she's kind of a little scary for me.

600
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:11,551
I was the first person to
actually fire an AT4 round,

601
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,387
and hit the tank.
Like, hit the target and blow the tank up.

602
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,389
- You're impressive as hell.
- I know!

603
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,766
Golly.

604
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,603
Trust me, a lack of confidence
is not a weakness of mine.

605
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,040
- Are you having a good night?
- Yeah.

606
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,857
- It's better now.
- Good.

607
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,984
I think Jessica could be
wife material.

608
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,363
I don't understand how
she could be single at 34.

609
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,086
There's got to be something wrong, right?

610
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,784
I haven't found anything wrong yet,
and I'm trying.

611
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,869
I know everybody wants kids
and stuff like that,

612
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,996
so, like, once we get married,

613
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,290
can we go ahead and start
or do we need to wait a year?

614
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,934
Do we need to get to know each other
even more for the next year?

615
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,920
I could totally... I'm not on a timeline.

616
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,172
Okay. That's what I was wondering, like...

617
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,316
No, look, like...

618
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,885
I want to make sure that you're not here
just to start a family.

619
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,095
I want to make sure.

620
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,596
Okay, look, listen up.

621
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,473
I'm a fucking catch over here.

622
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,237
I'm a fucking catch.

623
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,519
I don't need your sperm.

624
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,771
I knew you were LC by your voice.

625
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,981
You have a beautiful voice.

626
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,441
A few guys have told me
I have a great voice.

627
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,361
Dang it,
I wasn't the first one to say that.

628
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:17,242
If I had a wife,
I'd want her to be happy, free-spirited

629
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,869
willing to be adventurous,

630
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:24,374
and I think that is one of the reasons
that LC's been top of my list.

631
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,294
How tired are you of
getting the marriage questions?

632
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,022
- I haven't really gotten any marriage...
- Really?

633
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,816
- You want to get married?
- Sure, let's do it.

634
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,842
- Alright, cool.
- That was super easy.

635
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,343
I guess we can go now.

636
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,803
I'm LC.

637
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,016
I'm 26 and I'm from Tampa, Florida.

638
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,893
I definitely want to get married.
Who doesn't want to feel loved?

639
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,146
Like, that's just a basic human necessity.

640
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,398
If you say you don't want it,
you're a liar.

641
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,442
Go to therapy. Like...

642
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,903
I'm not going to look as nice
as anybody else that would propose to you.

643
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,614
But I'm the only one wearing shorts.

644
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,033
I'm wearing ripped high-waisted jeans.

645
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,577
I've never been a fan of
high-waisted pants.

646
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,120
Don't waste a perfectly good ass.

647
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,371
You're so forward, Barnett!

648
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,998
You know what I'm into.

649
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,591
- Hello.
- Hi, Cameron.

650
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,301
Oh, I'm so happy it's you.

651
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,178
I'm happy it's you.

652
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,847
I was really looking forward to
talking to you again.

653
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,530
I was looking forward to talking to you.

654
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,934
How are you feeling right now? Tell me.

655
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,771
I'm feeling like I had a few connections.

656
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,303
I don't know if I should admit this, but I
felt the strongest connection with you.

657
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,902
Oh, I felt a strong connection
with you, too.

658
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,028
Good, I hope so.

659
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,157
What was it that really drew you to me?

660
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,700
That your vibe is great.

661
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,745
Like, I just feel a good chemistry
with you,

662
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,121
like a connection.

663
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,623
- It doesn't feel forced.
- Right.

664
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,541
So, now you tell me,

665
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,586
what's the most important attribute of...

666
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,254
I guess that you want in your wife?

667
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:58,301
Someone who's not afraid to
tell me things that are difficult.

668
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,681
Someone who understands
the type of person that I am,

669
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:07,102
because I think that
I'm kind of unusual in some ways,

670
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,187
being a scientist but also...

671
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,774
I worked as a firefighter for,
like, seven years.

672
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,150
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

673
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,570
I feel like I'm also
a pretty sensitive guy,

674
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,572
which can be good or bad.

675
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,410
I appreciate a man who has sensitivity.

676
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,787
What's the last thing
that you cried about?

677
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,415
My mom was diagnosed with
Parkinson's disease.

678
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,460
So it's just some of the difficult things
with my mom.

679
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,795
I understand.

680
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,922
I'm really sensitive about my family, too.

681
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,550
Sometimes I just love my family so much.

682
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,718
I feel the same way.

683
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,553
Oh, my God, I'm getting emotional.

684
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,435
Yeah,
I'm getting a little emotional.

685
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,229
Wow, gosh.

686
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,648
Oh, Cameron, I wish I could hug you.

687
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,693
- I would really love that.
- I know. I know.

688
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,826
I have never talked this much
about emotions in my life.

689
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,955
Like, it makes such a huge difference
when there are no distractions.

690
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,124
Like, there's no phones, no text messages,

691
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,544
no worrying about what people think
or how we look.

692
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,921
I mean, I'm sitting here, crying

693
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,215
with a man who I've never seen before.

694
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,011
And it's day two. Oh, my God.

695
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,596
- Oh, my God.
- You look happy.

696
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,847
I know I do.

697
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,349
- I think I found one.
- What?

698
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,733
We freaking cried together today, guys.

699
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,794
- What?
- Wait, why? Tell me more.

700
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,652
Today?

701
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,863
Yeah. So, we were just
talking about our family,

702
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,449
and then we were both like,
"We're getting emotional."

703
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,252
He's like, "Me too,"
and it was just like...

704
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,537
We were just crying about
how much we love our families!

705
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,104
- That is sweet!
- I was just like, "Oh, my God,

706
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,643
- I'm really crying right now!"
- That is so sweet!

707
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,228
- I know, I thought so, too.
- I love it.

708
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,339
I can't believe I just cried
in a pod on a date.

709
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,507
In a freaking pod.

710
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,009
You cried in a pod!

711
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,856
So is he your number one choice right now?

712
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,931
Yeah, he is, for sure.

713
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,066
There's never been a time in my life

714
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:23,738
when I've been able to
really focus solely on finding love.

715
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,240
Here in the experiment,

716
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,909
you spend every second of every minute

717
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,112
searching for your soulmate.

718
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,021
How's your day going so far?

719
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,375
I had four hours of dates!

720
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,418
Yeah.

721
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,379
I have talked so much.

722
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,714
I was looking forward
to seeing you.

723
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,798
Me, too.

724
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,718
We talk about so much stuff,

725
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,179
but then we don't ask the big questions,
you know?

726
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,265
Yeah, so, okay. So, this one...

727
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,391
Okay, let's do this.

728
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,477
This date, we'll dedicate to
asking the big questions.

729
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,561
Totally.

730
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,397
My last serious relationship

731
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,107
was with a guy who was 41.

732
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,861
At that point in my life, I felt like
I was fast-forwarding my life a bit.

733
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,010
Is that what you're worried
that I'm feeling about you?

734
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,742
Yeah, I feel like you will be
in that position with me, probably.

735
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,347
Don't let that be something
that's sitting there being a block on you.

736
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,582
Okay, I just want
to be realistic.

737
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,041
She's 34, I'm 24.

738
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,544
I don't care. To me, age is a mindset.

739
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,921
Like, integrity is everything to me.

740
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,423
I'm definitely...

741
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,758
super... Christian.

742
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,804
Holy shit,
we're the same fucking version.

743
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,556
It's like, I want to raise my kids

744
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,851
with religion, Christianity,
and, you know, be very...

745
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,912
- Because that's how I was raised.
- Yeah.

746
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,897
And, you know,
I have a tattoo on my ribs, like,

747
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,458
it's a cross with my parents' initials
on the top and bottom.

748
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,835
My sister, my brother...

749
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,237
...on an empty plaque, so when I have kids
I can initial their names in it,

750
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,615
and Psalm 19:14 going across it.

751
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,198
I love that.

752
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,160
That makes me happy.

753
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,999
- How many kids do you want?
- Three.

754
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,959
- Three? I'm down.
- Okay.

755
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,336
I want two boys and a girl.

756
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,128
I like that.

757
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,504
My face hurts.

758
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,341
- Why?
- I'm smiling a lot.

759
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,634
- You are?
- Maybe.

760
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,969
That makes me so happy.

761
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,483
I'm learning things
about myself,

762
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,277
and I'm realizing
there are things I'm looking for

763
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,780
- that I didn't know I was looking for.
- Exactly.

764
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,282
So, this set of guidelines
that I came in with...

765
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,744
"Oh, you know,
I want someone between these ages,

766
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,746
and somebody who's into this."

767
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,456
The guy that I'm into

768
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,917
- meets zero of those criteria!
- Who knows?

769
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,295
Today, Mark told me that he has a tattoo
of a cross on his chest,

770
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,256
and he has two openings for his kids.

771
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,341
Oh!

772
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,094
And, like, I want to be a mom
more than anything, too,

773
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,806
and for me to know that somebody's ready
for that kind of a thing...

774
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,101
I've never had those type of discussions
with anyone.

775
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,477
It's overwhelming.

776
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,815
For me, that age gap had to be,
like, the most real,

777
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,025
<i>crazy</i> connection.

778
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,319
Love at first s...

779
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,155
- Talk?
- ...voice?

780
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,530
I would have never guessed
that I would've developed

781
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,619
the feelings that I'm feeling
in a couple of days.

782
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,707
Mark and I are really creating
a true soul connection,

783
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,668
but sometimes I snap back to reality
and think about,

784
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,563
what are my friends going to think,
what are my parents going to think?

785
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,797
Mark is...

786
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,674
five years younger than my baby brother,

787
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,718
who's five years younger than me.

788
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,345
Alright, boys.

789
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,370
- Hello.
- Hello.

790
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,633
What's up, Jessica?

791
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,061
- What are you doing over there?
- Nothing. I just got here.

792
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,314
Jessica, I really enjoy talking to.

793
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,191
She's just so freaking cool.

794
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,403
So if we were married, what would you
want your husband to be doing

795
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,031
- when you came home?
- I like this question.

796
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,491
It doesn't have to be anything special,

797
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,827
but just to come home and have...

798
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,455
you to hang out with on the couch.

799
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,081
Yeah.

800
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,582
Just, like, arms.

801
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,834
Yeah. Arms.

802
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,755
Even if you've had a stressful day,
I just want you to look at me and be like,

803
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,673
"I'm just so happy to see him."

804
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,552
"You brighten up when you see me."
That's all I want.

805
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,388
- That's exactly what I'm looking for.
- Yeah.

806
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,640
I work really, really hard.

807
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,936
Having something to come home to
is, like, the goal.

808
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,570
I have never asked anyone
how they would be as a husband,

809
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:37,366
but discussing that today with Barnett,
I thought was the hottest thing ever.

810
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:42,121
After a couple of conversations with Mark
I decided, you know, this is my guy,

811
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,457
but now I'm questioning that a little bit

812
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,418
because I'm having
these really intense feelings for Barnett.

813
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:52,131
At this point, I can see them both
being my husband, which is crazy.

814
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,945
Being here is something that
is so extremely surreal

815
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,073
and unlike anything
I've ever experienced before.

816
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,659
Things that happen in a day here

817
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,495
may take months or longer outside.

818
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,580
It's a roller coaster ride of emotions.

819
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,500
How are you?

820
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,044
Oh! So much better now.

821
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,818
I've been thinking about you nonstop.

822
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,094
- Obviously.
- I've been thinking about you, too.

823
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,804
I've been talking about you.

824
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,514
Like crazy.

825
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,057
I love that.

826
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,980
I've been, like, trying to imagine you.

827
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,565
Obviously that's...

828
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,567
kind of impossible, but...

829
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,152
It is.

830
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:58,072
In my mind it's almost like
you can see me, but obviously you can't.

831
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,285
I'm just thinking,
"I have to look good for her."

832
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,245
- But it's like, it's weird.
- Aww.

833
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,746
You say all the right stuff.

834
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,416
But it's true, though.

835
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,708
It's true.

836
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,964
- Cameron...
- Yes?

837
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,674
I think I love you.

838
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,550
I love you.

839
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,097
Wow.

840
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,601
I love you.

841
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,812
I love you!

842
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,399
Did we just say that?

843
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,359
Yeah.

844
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,071
Oh, I can't breathe.

845
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,531
Okay.

846
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,077
Are you crying?

847
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,539
Just a tiny bit.

848
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,628
It's all becoming, very very real.

849
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,048
I've fallen in love with her
without ever having seen her.

850
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,507
Part of me does think,

851
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,051
"Are you being rash?"

852
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,220
But it feels so right.

853
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,183
It feels like I'm jumping out of a plane.

854
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,852
Scary as fuck.

855
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,426
- Yeah.
- But amazing.

856
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,438
It is scary.

857
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,399
But I trust you.

858
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,776
I trust you.

859
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,156
If we get married, then,

860
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,158
you know, that's it for me.

861
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,620
- Yeah, me, too.
- We have to make it work.

862
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,163
We do.

863
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,873
Yeah.

864
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,094
It's terrifying,

865
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,931
thinking that something that
I've been looking for my whole life

866
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:50,643
could possibly be with the person
that's on the other side of that wall.

867
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,312
I feel like I'm falling in love
with a stranger,

868
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,940
but, at the same time,
I feel like I know everything about him.

869
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,360
I wish that I could...

870
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,738
just kinda hold you right now.

871
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,406
Yeah.

872
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,573
Me, too.

873
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,910
You're, like, four feet away.

874
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,663
But I'm right here.

875
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,039
Yeah, you're here.

876
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
I know.

877
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,596
Hey, what's up, Diamond?

878
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,848
I've been waiting for you.

879
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,392
Aww. I've been waiting for you, too.

880
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,770
- I want to learn more about you.
- What do you want to know?

881
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,190
- What do you want to learn?
- Your true, deepest, darkest fears

882
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,318
as it relates to marrying someone.

883
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,195
I like the fact that he cannot see me.

884
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,073
I like the fact that Carlton is
really getting a chance to know me.

885
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,075
I really like when he opens up to me.

886
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,619
I think it shows that he trusts me,

887
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,955
it shows that he is safe with me.

888
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,084
It makes me feel like these are the words
I've been missing from a man.

889
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,670
My fear is getting hurt.

890
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,005
I have been vulnerable,

891
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:04,175
and, in my past relationships,
I felt like I was giving my all

892
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,926
and trying to make that person happy.

893
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,096
At the end of the day, I didn't,
and that's why I'm here.

894
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,388
I want to be happy.

895
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,183
I don't want to be disappointed,

896
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,560
- and I don't want to be embarrassed.
- Right.

897
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,064
I've been taught to be strong,
I've been taught not to cry,

898
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,273
I've been taught to...

899
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,275
You know, I come from a strong cloth.

900
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,196
Yeah. How do you think I feel?
It's like, "boys don't cry!"

901
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:30,201
Like, that's constantly conditioned in
black men's heads since we were boys.

902
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,160
I know.

903
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:35,748
I have had to learn how to open up,
and it's okay to...

904
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,043
be sensitive and emotional
and vulnerable.

905
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:44,256
I'm a preacher's kid, and because
I'm so outgoing, I'm so outspoken,

906
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,883
people see me and they say,

907
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,344
"Oh, he must not be insecure
about anything."

908
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,137
But sometimes, on the inside,

909
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,515
I haven't always felt that confident,

910
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,600
and I've always been
this hopeless romantic.

911
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,769
I want to be loved

912
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,562
for who I truly am.

913
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,481
Unconditionally,

914
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,691
and without restraint.

915
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,027
Wow, that's deep.

916
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:11,367
My biggest dream is that I finally find
a wife who will love me unconditionally,

917
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,285
who's kind of like that ride or die.

918
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,663
But I have a big secret.

919
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,249
At one point in my young adult life,

920
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:22,378
I found myself attracted to
just hearts, period.

921
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,171
Like, it didn't have a gender.

922
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,881
It wasn't about sex for me.

923
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,092
I dated guys and girls.

924
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,469
But I want a wife now,

925
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:36,100
because I feel like women
bring a certain, like, nurturing love

926
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:40,229
and affection to the table that,
like, I don't get from a guy.

927
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:45,776
My biggest worry is that I will
find someone that I am super in love with

928
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,238
and want to marry,
and then, at the last minute,

929
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,657
she will not be able to
walk down the aisle

930
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,452
because she just can't
be married to someone like me.

931
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,216
What's up?

932
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,552
I'm the happiest I've been
in a very long time.

933
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,054
It's not everything,
but I'm on cloud nine.

934
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,889
Jessica.

935
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,892
I need a...

936
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,203
...drink.

937
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,230
I'm the type of person
that can feel vibes and situations,

938
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,900
and I'm feeling a shift in Barnett.

939
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,527
And I realize that,
yeah, he's into Jessica.

940
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,491
- Is this too much?
- It's too little.

941
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,364
Why do you leave so much air up top?

942
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,908
That is out of my control.

943
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,284
I came into this

944
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,913
being open-minded to the idea that
I could possibly find love.

945
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,790
What's exciting is that
I feel like I've found a person

946
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,336
I could spend the rest of my life with
in a very short period of time,

947
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,419
and that's Jessica.

948
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,881
I want you to know something.

949
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,218
I don't let a lot of people
in my heart a lot. Um...

950
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,930
I shut down,
and I think I've always been like that.

951
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,807
When I walked in the room
from the first time I met you,

952
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,434
I knew...

953
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,061
It was just like, I was blown...

954
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,729
I don't know how to explain it,

955
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,690
but I walked around
the right side of the couch,

956
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,025
turned the corner,

957
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,361
and you said, "Hey,"
and I was like, "Yep, that's it."

958
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,571
I don't understand why.

959
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,365
I tried to press the brakes,

960
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,493
but you're the first person
that's ever really gotten me.

961
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,537
You're the cutest thing ever, by the way.

962
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,873
- What do you mean?
- I just love when you get so passionate.

963
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,500
What do you mean?

964
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,210
Ahh, I just want to hug you.

965
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,338
Kind of everything you say,

966
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,259
beyond anything I could have expected.

967
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,426
Like...

968
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:36,971
it was just mind-blowing.

969
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,473
You know, my last girlfriend,

970
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,726
I had my heart broken and stuff.
And, um...

971
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,772
You know, I had gotten cheated on
and whatever, but it took this experience

972
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:50,484
to really just break down any kind of wall
that I thought I had about my heart.

973
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,568
And...

974
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,656
when I tell you, I really don't open up
like how I am with you to anybody, like...

975
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,866
I...

976
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,995
You know, I...

977
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,872
God. Um...

978
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,126
I want you.

979
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,299
You know, I ask you, you know...

980
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,262
Do you want to spend
the rest your life with me?

981
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,553
Like, where's your mind at?

982
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:30,065
We've come a really long way
in a matter of days, not weeks,

983
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,524
and...

984
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,819
like, I can definitely...

985
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,616
see us walking out of here together.

986
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,493
I really can.
It's kind of weird to say that.

987
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,746
That's what I'm talking about!
Whoo!

988
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,373
That's the cutest.

989
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,211
I want to spend the rest of my life
with a real partner,

990
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:55,132
and I couldn't be more ready
to do that with Jessica.

991
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,425
I'm all in.

992
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,819
- We'll talk soon.
- OK.

993
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:58,843
Alright, bye.

994
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:15,027
I think today was the biggest checkpoint
of this entire thing.

995
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,946
- Yeah. Of course.
- Like, "Fuck, this is real."

996
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,114
Like...

997
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,718
Things like emotions are starting to
come into play for Jessica,

998
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,745
and then, like, real stories
were going underneath the surface.

999
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,664
It's all here now.

1000
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,750
- Who's your number one?
- Don't worry about it.

1001
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:34,254
It's stressful thinking that other people
have any connection with someone

1002
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,498
that you thought you had
a really good connection with.

1003
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,424
Jessica?

1004
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,512
There it is. It's Jessica.

1005
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,263
But...

1006
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,975
Mark's over here,
he's super excited about her.

1007
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:51,397
Mark is a passionate guy,
and he's excited about Jessica a lot.

1008
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,483
And he's 24, and she's 34.

1009
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,444
I don't know if...
I don't know if he's ready.

1010
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,071
I don't know if he's ready.

1011
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,117
The problem is, I haven't gotten
really deep or emotional with her yet.

1012
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,345
- I've gotten a little bit...
- Now's your chance, man.

1013
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,370
I'm nervous about...

1014
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:10,708
being myself and and getting hurt,
and hurting people, so...

1015
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:15,754
I'm also... I'm afraid of opening up
and losing that connection.

1016
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,965
Tell her how you feel,
tell her what's going on,

1017
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,467
break down the emotional
and give everything you've got,

1018
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,845
because the pain of
knowing you didn't give it all

1019
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,888
and you'll never know the answer
is terrible,

1020
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,932
and you should avoid that at all costs.

1021
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:28,891
Just do it.

1022
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,895
This has made me so open, I feel like.

1023
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,689
I actually am with you on that.

1024
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,691
- Like I enjoy how...
- I enjoy it.

1025
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,901
Yeah, we get to the essence of each other

1026
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,446
and it's not like, "Oh,
I'm blinded by his blue eyes."

1027
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,989
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

1028
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,792
It's like, this is really what I want,
and laying it all on the line.

1029
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,910
You tell me who you are, honestly,

1030
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,913
and I'll tell you who I am, honestly,
and if you accept it, you do.

1031
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,225
- And if don't, you're just not for me.
- Not for me, yeah.

1032
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,959
Yeah, this has definitely changed my life.

1033
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,420
Five days in and I know

1034
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,673
who I want to be my future husband.

1035
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,924
I can't believe it.

1036
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,634
It's only been five days!

1037
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,679
Oh, my God, I've had meals
in my refrigerator for longer than that.

1038
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,723
Like, that's crazy.

1039
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,103
I've spent every second
of this experiment

1040
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,105
focusing on finding my wife,

1041
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,024
and I think I've found her.

1042
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:23,280
I feel immense attraction to her,
and I've never seen her before.

1043
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,910
I know Lauren is the one,

1044
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,455
and I don't need to do any more searching.

1045
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,624
I'm ready to propose to Lauren.

1046
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,674
- Hello?
- Hello.

1047
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,885
I'm happy to hear your voice.

1048
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,512
I'm very happy to hear your voice.

1049
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,475
Are you sitting down,
or are you standing up?

1050
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,143
I'm sitting down.

1051
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,891
Do you want to...

1052
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,271
approach the wall?

1053
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,980
Yeah.

1054
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,609
- Come up to the wall?
- Uh-huh.

1055
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,734
Okay.

1056
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,160
Lauren Michelle Speed...

1057
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,624
Holy shit.

1058
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,798
I feel so blessed to have you
come into my life.

1059
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,968
I love you so much,

1060
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,428
and I want to...

1061
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,639
spend the rest of my life with you.

1062
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,104
Will you marry me?

1063
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,608
Oh, my God, yes.

1064
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,193
Yes, Cameron,

1065
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,256
I will marry you, I will be your wife!

1066
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,500
I feel like I'm in a dream right now.

1067
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,962
I feel like I'm floating.

1068
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,305
We're engaged.

1069
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,388
We're engaged!

1070
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,685
This literally feels like...

1071
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,729
like a fairy tale.

1072
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,898
You're such a beautiful person.

1073
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,901
I don't have to see you to say that.

1074
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,534
- You're my future husband.
- You're my future wife.

1075
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,077
Holy shit!

1076
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,832
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye!

1077
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,298
Tomorrow I finally get to see Cameron

1078
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,675
in person for the first time.

1079
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,220
I get to look him in the eyes
and grab his face and kiss it.

1080
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:57,184
I'm super excited to just meet this man
who I've fallen in love with, finally.

1081
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,271
I'm engaged!

1082
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,355
She said yes.

1083
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,736
Oh, my God!

1084
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:12,366
<i>♪ For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow ♪</i>

1085
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,450
Pick him up!

1086
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,665
I never thought I would create
one connection, let alone two.

1087
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,599
I don't know where these guys came from.

1088
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,718
You know,
Mark is everything I've ever wanted,

1089
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,423
and he wants to walk away from this
being married,

1090
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,218
and it's hard for me to accept that...

1091
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,095
he feels that way for me.

1092
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:37,849
Something in the back of my mind is like,
"Can this really work in the real world?"

1093
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,310
Our age difference is massive,

1094
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,522
and the fact that my relationship
with Barnett has progressed

1095
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:46,733
so much in the matter of a couple of days,

1096
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,152
I have to see what happens with Barnett.

1097
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,569
Hey, B.

1098
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,281
- What's up, girl?
- What you doing?

1099
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,701
Just chilling. How you feeling?

1100
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,705
I feel really happy that
you're my last date tonight.

1101
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,918
I know who Jessica is
still interacting with,

1102
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,482
and I know how they feel towards her.

1103
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,588
It's like,
is she telling everybody the same thing?

1104
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,424
That's actually a big fear
I have right now.

1105
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,510
I don't want to throw my heart out there
and just like...

1106
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,846
actually be, you know, hurt.

1107
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,560
Don't blow smoke up my ass real quick.

1108
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,145
Are you mad at me?

1109
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,188
Are you mad at me right now?

1110
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,272
No.

1111
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,315
Talk to me.

1112
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,944
Oh, gosh.

1113
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,868
I'm going through so much turmoil
right now.

1114
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,577
Why?

1115
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,789
Let me say something. I feel like
you don't know where my head is.

1116
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,460
Literally, I think...
What? You just got done with Mark.

1117
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,879
I knew that he had just left with you.

1118
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,548
He was so sure of everything,
and that scared me.

1119
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,633
As soon as I saw that, I was like...

1120
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,470
maybe she's just been kind of just...

1121
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:00,182
She wasn't feeling the way I was feeling.

1122
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,477
You don't think I hear things
on the other side?

1123
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,655
There's multiple girls
that really like you,

1124
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,315
but the girls don't think
you're serious about them.

1125
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,485
And literally, like,

1126
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:15,238
the military girl is going to kick my ass,
I know it.

1127
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,574
Like, don't make this one-sided.

1128
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,249
Jessica, Jessica, Jessica...

1129
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,418
- What?
- Hmm?

1130
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,170
- What?
- You've been high on my list

1131
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,546
since the beginning.

1132
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,217
If this place had nobody, no other guys

1133
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,219
and no other girls,

1134
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,722
like, I would propose to you tomorrow.

1135
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,516
You would?

1136
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,353
You are my yin to my yang.

1137
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,230
I am so fucking happy right now.

1138
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:53,860
I'm 34 years old and no one has ever
said those words to me,

1139
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,278
that they're ready to propose,

1140
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,198
that they want to walk out of here
being married to me.

1141
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,242
Barnett just changed everything,

1142
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,160
and I think I would say yes.

1143
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:07,499
- Um, what do you need me to do?
- What do I need you to do?

1144
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:08,982
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

1145
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:12,712
If you want me to pull the plug on
those other things tomorrow, I will.

1146
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,300
I just want...
I want a clear decision made.

1147
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:18,926
Okay.

1148
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,725
All right.

1149
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,981
<i>♪ Get ready for a miracle ♪</i>

1150
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,817
<i>♪ Let it feel a little magical ♪</i>

1151
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,405
Yesterday,
Cameron and I got engaged.

1152
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,449
He asked me to be his wife!

1153
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,451
I have a fiancé, y'all!

1154
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,371
Oh, my God. I'm gonna be a married woman.
I'm so excited.

1155
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:47,956
Okay.

1156
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:53,920
And today I finally get to see him
in person for the first time.

1157
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,841
I'm super excited to just meet this man
who I've fallen in love with.

1158
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:10,353
Of course I'm excited
to see what she looks like.

1159
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,899
I've tried to just kind of
leave it as a blank slate,

1160
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:17,736
so that, you know, however she looks
I want to appreciate that.

1161
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,530
Throughout this process,

1162
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,494
I wasn't focused
on what the person looked like.

1163
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,927
I wasn't focused on their race,
if they were white or black.

1164
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,788
I wasn't focused on, you know,
if they're too young or too old.

1165
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,290
But now that I'm here,

1166
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,541
I'm scared,

1167
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,835
because what if he doesn't like how
I look?

1168
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,046
What if I don't like how he looks?

1169
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,425
She's maybe feeling the same way
I'm feeling right now,

1170
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:43,428
which is a little crazy, a little nervous,

1171
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:44,971
a little bit nauseous.

1172
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,143
There is a chance that,
by the end of this,

1173
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,354
he may not feel the same,

1174
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,064
and, to me, that's terrifying.

1175
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,857
I can't breathe.

1176
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,570
It's just scary.

1177
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,448
It's just frightening.

1178
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,699
That's all.

1179
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,162
As the diligent scientist that I am,

1180
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:15,043
I came into this wanting to test
that hypothesis: is love blind?

1181
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,502
So...

1182
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,506
it's a success!

1183
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,759
I've met the person I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

1184
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,179
And I have no idea what she looks like.

1185
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,488
Oh, God.

1186
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,073
I'm 100% in love.

1187
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,285
And it didn't come from seeing someone
across the room.

1188
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,494
who I thought was hot.

1189
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,038
It came from really connecting
with someone

1190
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,708
on a deeper level
than I've ever experienced before.

1191
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,501
Shit, I'm nervous as hell.

1192
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,337
I don't know if I'm gonna laugh,
cry or pass out.

1193
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,338
Oh, my God.

1194
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,632
- Fuck.
- It's giving me butterflies.

1195
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,719
Baby!

1196
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,554
Holy shit,
that's my fiancée.

1197
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,768
He was definitely not
what I expected.

1198
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,437
I've made a huge mistake.

1199
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,774
When you really fall in love with someone,
the physical attraction builds.

1200
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,107
You're not gonna let me go,
are you?

1201
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,578
The physical connection
is absolutely there.

1202
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,502
I wouldn't change anything
about him.

1203
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,255
Moving in with my fiancé is
gonna be another adventure.

1204
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,692
- I'm always cleaning the place.
- Heard that before.

1205
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,110
Why are you marrying my daughter?

1206
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,094
Have you ever been in a room
full of black people?

1207
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,388
I can't lose a love like this again.

1208
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,681
It would destroy me.

1209
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,726
I was fucking honest.
I didn't fucking deceive nobody.

1210
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,853
You were so confused a week ago.

1211
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:01,524
I want to make sure that you're doing
what's right for you.

1212
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,442
Listen to me!

1213
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,819
Stop interrupting me, please,
for the love of God.

1214
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,464
We're gonna go back
and look at this,

1215
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,239
and be like,
"Did I make the right choice?"

1216
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,408
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1217
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,326
Fucker!

1218
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,203
Do I want to marry him? I don't know.

1219
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,581
Marriage is forever.

1220
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,375
The stakes are high.

1221
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,543
This isn't just some fantasy.

1222
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,504
This is the rest of our lives.

1223
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,798
White or black, tall or short,

1224
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,299
too young or too old...

1225
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:29,094
I always wanted to believe
that love is blind.

1226
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:35,183
Today, we're here to discover
if love is blind.

1227
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:38,478
Do you take him
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1228
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,961
I don't know
if I can go through with this wedding.

1229
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,024
I cannot do this!

1230
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,771
Please stop recording this.
