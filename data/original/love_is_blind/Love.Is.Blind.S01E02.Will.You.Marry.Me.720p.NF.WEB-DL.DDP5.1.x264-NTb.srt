1
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,348
I never expected,
walking into this facility...

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,309
that I would find my wife
and mean that,

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,602
but here we are.

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,191
Everything has just been building up
to this moment,

5
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,029
to meet this man who I feel like
fell out of the sky.

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,780
I feel like he was made in a factory,

7
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,116
like he was specifically
put together for me.

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,620
I think I'm just
a little nervous about

9
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,789
seeing her for the first time, physically.

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,460
I hope that, you know,
her expectations aren't let down.

11
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,961
I don't think they will be,

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,130
but, you know, you just never know,

13
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,468
when you add in that physical element,
how that might change things.

14
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,471
When we're in the pods,

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,639
we don't have to think
about how we look physically,

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,763
because they can't see us.

17
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,559
So right now,

18
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,810
I'm like, oh my God,

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,534
what if a piece of my hair's sticking up,

20
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,939
I can't have bad breath.
What if I'm sweating?

21
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,649
I'm just anticipating

22
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,944
the moment of getting
to physically see him,

23
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,237
and I'm a nervous wreck.

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,573
But I'm ready.

25
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,509
Oh, my gosh.

26
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,762
Cameron!

27
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,061
- I'm so excited to see you.
- I'm excited, too.

28
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,828
I'm never going to let you go.

29
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,106
I hope not.

30
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,149
I promise you.

31
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,110
I cannot wait to marry you.

32
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,193
Mm.

33
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,364
I feel like this environment has

34
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,367
allowed me to date outside my race,

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,701
without even knowing,

36
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,120
mainly because

37
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,122
Cameron and I's connection

38
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,082
was so strong that

39
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,668
I really didn't care what color he was.

40
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,294
It just turns out that he was white.

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,381
Let me look at you.

42
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,738
- You're so handsome.
- You're beautiful.

43
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,928
I can't believe how beautiful you are.

44
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,096
Oh...

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,764
You're so handsome.

46
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,728
You literally look like a prince.

47
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,892
Like Prince Charming.

48
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,271
<i>♪ I put my hands up, I put my head down ♪</i>

will you still marry me?

51
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,655
Of course, yes.

You are strong.

61
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,024
It doesn't even seem
like she's real

62
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,984
because it seems too perfect.

63
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,069
I couldn't be happier.

64
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,446

This is my first time
kissing a white man.

76
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,061
I have large,

77
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,437
full lips,

78
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,024
and I was scared that the proportion

79
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,817
was going to be like, "Oh, my God,

80
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,445
my lips are going to be a lot
for his smaller lips,"

81
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,781
but he is an excellent kisser.

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,532
- See you soon.
- Okay.

83
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,955
Honestly, our journey is just beginning.

84
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,832
Obviously, we have
our emotional connection,

85
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,669
and now we are going to be
whisked away

86
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,507
on a beautiful, tropical
romantic vacation to Mexico.

87
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,301
I can't wait to just sit with him
on the beach,

88
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,179
and watch the sunset and sunrise,

89
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,889
and drink frozen drinks,

90
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,975
and take advantage of him.

91
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,150
It's a dream,
being able to touch her,

92
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,861
and smell her perfume,

93
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,239
and to know that I'm not just in love

94
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,324
with how gorgeous she is,

95
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,119
but the person that she is.

96
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,081
I'm very vocal
about the struggles of black people,

97
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,792
and in the back of my mind,

98
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,794
I am thinking a lot of my friends or peers

99
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,357
will be like, "Wow, Lauren,
you going to go marry a white man?"

100
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,465
But, at the end of the day,

101
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,593
I feel like I can still
want the best for black people.

102
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,554
I can still want black people to win.

103
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,222
I can still voice my opinions

104
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,933
about how black people
are treated in this country,

105
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,476
and still love who I love.

106
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,146
Being in an interracial relationship

107
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,605
will be difficult.

108
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,899
but I feel pretty confident that

109
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,902
we'll be able to take on this, uh,

110
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,989
mean world that's out there.

111
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,365
Us against the world.

114
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,635
I'm pouring us glasses of wine.

115
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,262
Because we're classy.

116
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,181

118

Before coming into this facility,

119
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,395
I was very superficial.

120
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,679
I had to be with a supermodel.

121
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,357
I had to be with a beauty queen.

122
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,650
Now, I'm ready to focus on what matters.

123
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,903
It's more about what's on the inside.

124
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,488
If that heart is beautiful,

125
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,239
if your soul speaks to my soul.

126
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,160
Have you guys tried
to imagine the faces

127
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,745
of the people you're talking to?

128
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,913
Yeah, of course.

129
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,206
I can't.

130
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,332
Every single one.

131
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,000
I can imagine the body types,

132
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,770
based off what they say
they're interested in,

133
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,772
like their activity level,
the stuff they do, their hobbies.

134
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,507
But I can't see their faces.

135
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,468
People here are falling in love
through a wall.

136
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,304
It's a crazy kind of magic, but it works.

137
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,722
With Damian, I was like...

138
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,391
He joked he was like, "I'm 5'4".

139
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,143
I'm like, "I wouldn't care".
Like, I'm obsessed with you.

140
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,207
Whatever woman you end up with,
Damian, is gonna be one lucky lady.

141
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,458
To the rest of our lives.

142
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,608
- Cheers.
- Happy.

143
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,497
- Hello?
- Who is it?

144
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:55,957
It's Damian.

145
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,916
Thank God.

146
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,505
I couldn't stop thinking
about you today.

147
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,756
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

148
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,009
You got my butterflies turning.

149
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,804
Get out of here, little guys.

150
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,305
Get out.

151
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,682
You know, it's so funny,

152
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,559
we're going on our fifth date, I believe?

153
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,495
- Fourth or fifth.
- Wow.

154
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,353
Yeah.

155
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,189
We're sliding into each others DM's,
I guess.

156
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,776
I love that.

157
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,903
You got a really cute sense of humor,

158
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,781
and I'm really digging that, really hard.

159
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,908
Thanks, I'm silly.

160
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,285
Yeah, I like that a lot.

161
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,246
My name is Giannina Gibelli,

162
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,664
and I'm 25 years old.

163
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,874
I'm from Venezuela.

164
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,958
Caracas, Venezuela.

165
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,004
Growing up, I was always, like,
the sweet one.

166
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,423
My mom called me her <i>dulce de leche.</i>

167
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,550
I taught myself English by reading.

168
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,343
My mom told me that she would always

169
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,345
take me to bed, and like,

170
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,307
I would have a book on my chest
every single time.

171
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,145
You've given me nothing,
but like, I guess,

172
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,356
"vibe" always sounds like
such a weird word, but...

173
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,317
No, use the word "vibes."

174
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,527
Alright, so you've given me
really good vibes,

175
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,988
and I'm actually sitting
on the carpet right now...

176
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,908
I'm literally so close to the screen...

177
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,242
Are you really?

178
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,679
I'm literally sitting on the carpet
right now, criss-crossed legs.

179
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,598
- Me, too.
- Just chilling, looking at it.

180
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,831
Me, too.

181
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,335
What's important to you?

182
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,794
Uh, my family.

183
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,796
- Right.
- Yeah, my family for sure.

184
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,715
But, you know, I want to carry that on.

185
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,592
I want to have a family of my own someday,

186
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,553
and I want somebody to walk by my side,

187
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,305
not to walk in front of.

188
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,849
I adore that.

189
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,559
Yeah.

190
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,981
It's become so easy to talk to you,
and I've...

191
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,150
And I'm really starting to

192
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,735
emotionally connect with you.

193
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,030
I'm Damian Powers, and I'm 27 years old.

194
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,950
I came into this process
not knowing what to expect,

195
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,118
no matter how good-looking we are,

196
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,411
or what type of body we have,

197
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,535
we all want to be loved,
we all want to be accepted.

198
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,833
I want to find someone that just

199
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,710
loves me and accepts me

200
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,963
for everything that I am,

201
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,673
and everything that I'm not.

202
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,968
I'm really hoping to get to know you more
over these next few days.

203
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,678
I like you.

204
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,348
I like you a lot.

205
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,891
Yeah, I like you, too.

206
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,864
I know Diamond, and I've fallen in love
with this woman.

207
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,491
I feel very free.

208
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,286
I feel comforted in knowing that

209
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,870
no matter what I've been through,

210
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,414
no matter who I currently am,

211
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,500
that there's someone that just
wants to weather the storm together.

212
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,626
That's what I deserve,

213
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,752
and...

214
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,712
it's amazing.

215
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,636
Hello.

216
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,556
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

217
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,518
Through this whole week
spent with Carlton,

218
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,603
I feel safe.

219
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,397
I've never connected
with someone on this level.

220
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,902
I have waited for this
my whole life,

221
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,363
and I can't waste any more time.

222
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,119
- Diamond?
- Yes?

223
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,415
Will you be my wife?

224
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,208
Oh, my gosh.

225
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,463
Will you marry me?

226
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,718
Oh, my gosh.

227
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,765
- Yes.
- You will?

228
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,307
Yes.

229
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,893
Baby!

230
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,195
My dad passed away
when I was a very young girl.

231
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,447
I remember going to the funeral,

232
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,617
and I see ladybugs everywhere I went.

233
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,286
Today, I woke up,

234
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,789
and I literally seen a ladybug,

235
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,540
on the mirror.

236
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,002
I really thought that was my dad
talking to me,

237
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,089
reminding me that everything
is going to be okay.

238
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,966
Carlton is the man I've been praying for.

239
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,426
Yeah.

240
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,766
And I think everything
is going to be okay.

241
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,603
Don't cry.

242
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,563
I got you.

243
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,898
I got you forever.

244
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,234
I'm never going to break your heart.

245
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,446
I just wanna, like,
bust through the glass,

246
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,656
and just, like, hug you.

247
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,410
Let's do this, babe.

248
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,954
Let's get it.

249
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,206
I have found my forever

250
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,710
and I'm not letting any doubt,

251
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,795
any insecurities from the past

252
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,505
ruin this for me,

253
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,091
because it's the best
I've ever felt in my life,

254
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,219
and no one can take that away from me.

255
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,845
I love you.

256
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,179
I love you, too.

257
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,384
With all my heart.

258
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,724
Oh, God.

259
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,938
You know I can't breathe, right?

260
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,190
I can't either.
Like, it's a lot.

261
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,531
You've taught me so much
in such a short period of time.

262
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,409
It just became evident, day-by-day,

263
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,494
that there was no fears,

264
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,205
just feeling like I could
be myself with you,

265
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,624
and no matter what I tell you,

266
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,876
you'd accept me,

267
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,711
and not leave me,

268
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,130
because I feel
that I've been left many times.

269
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,217
And I found myself thanking God for you.

270
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,263
You make me feel like

271
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,348
I won't have to hide anything.

272
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,725
I won't have to

273
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,853
be anybody other than Carlton.

274
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,608
I can't see my life without you,
at this point.

275
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,158
I think God put you in my life
for a reason.

276
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,785
I think you are a phenomenal person.

277
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,120
Throughout this whole process,

278
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,538
we have been vulnerable,

279
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,499
and you inspire me.

280
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,543
I'm like, shaking. It's crazy.

281
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:20,633
<i>♪ There is a future ♪</i>

282

284
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,017
It's very touchy to decide

285
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,644
when to reveal

286
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,355
my sexuality to Diamond,

287
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,566
because I'm just not sure
how she'll handle it.

288
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,487
Going through this experience
in such a short amount of time,

289
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,364
I'm definitely closer,

290
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,200
and I have to be ready
to reveal this information.

291
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,534
I just...

292
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,037
don't think that I can do it right now.

293
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,832
I have experienced rejection in the past

294
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,168
by people that I thought would understand,

295
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,464
so I am afraid to ruin this.

296
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,800
My whole life, I've just been...

297
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,678
craving acceptance.

298
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,102
I'm going to make an amazing husband.

299
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,563
I'm going to be a great father.

300
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,027
Oh, gosh.

301
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,531
This is one of
the happiest days of my life.

304

Hello.

305
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,547
Kelly.

306
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,716
What's up?

307
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,259
My name is Kelly Chase.

308
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,427
I'm 33 years old,

309
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,847
and the dating scene for me,

310
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,682
it's just never been right.

311
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,559
I had gained about 40 pounds

312
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,560
a few years ago,

313
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,729
and I am just still not where
I would like to be.

314
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,105
And then I'm like, "Kelly,

315
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,375
someone out there
thinks you're beautiful the way you are."

316
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,984
I'm going to to sit down.

317
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,795
- Yeah.
- See if we can get real personal.

318
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,112
I'm Kenny Barnes.

319
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,447
I'm 27 years old,

320
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,909
and I've had great experiences
with past relationships,

321
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,702
but there's always that missing link.

322
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,580
I've had a tough time
with putting myself out there

323
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,249
to be vulnerable, and truly be valued.

324
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,961
So one of the biggest things
that I've had a problem with

325
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,047
is wanting to feel accepted.

326
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,049
So that's what I'm looking for.

327
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,429
Did you have a favorite childhood book?

328
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,473
I had a couple.

329
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,556
There's a book...

330
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,895
It was about a mom and her son.

331
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,205
- Yes.
- It was a little picture book,

332
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,149
and it was like,
"Forever my baby you will be..."

333
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,691
- Yes!
- I'm getting chills.

334
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,919
Oh my God, I love it.

335
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,528
It was my favorite childhood book,
and obviously I'm not a son,

336
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,781
but my mom read it to my sister and I.

337
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,449
Oh, my God.

338
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,701
Like, it is 100 percent my favorite book.

339
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,119
Holy smokes.

340
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,455
That hit me pretty good.

341
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,665
Aww!

342
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,251
To be honest with you,
I read it three or four years ago,

343
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,420
and I was going through
a transitional phase.

344
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,297
I just started with the company
I'm with now,

345
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,009
and it's kind of like
that moment of reflection,

346
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,761
like, things are great,

347
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,764
- but they're not where I want them to be.
- Right.

348
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,434
Personally,
I have felt recently...

349
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,728
It's like I felt like I had no one
to talk to.

350
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,897
- Yeah.
- It's like, there's work,

351
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,732
and I'm stressed out about that.

352
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,442
Let alone, it's family,

353
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,820
you know, stuff that's going on...

354
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,571
It's like I can't talk to anyone.

355
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,365
I literally can't talk to anyone.

356
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,117
- Yeah.
- Can't talk.

357
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,202
Yeah, you do, you feel alone.

358
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,375
Yeah, and it's funny...
Not "funny" you mention that, but,

359
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,751
for, like, months,

360
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,546
I have felt very, um, alone.

361
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,589
For like months.

362
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,718
And, excuse me for crying...

363
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,052
You okay?

364
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,512
Yeah, yeah...

365
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,389
But no, I just like...

366
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,350
- I want to give you a hug right now.
- I know, sorry.

367
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,562
No, it's okay. I'm a... I, I, I get it.

368
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,647
And, like, oh my gosh.

369
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,942
So you got me with the book, and...

370
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,862
I told you I'm not a crier,

371
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,406
but I feel it, right?

372
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,489
Yeah.

373
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,325
I love when guys cry.

374
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,077
Kenny can get emotional,

375
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,664
and I was just like, "Okay, I love you".

376
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,042
Yeah.

377
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,459
I've wanted...

378
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,129
a best friend for a while now.

379
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,050
I appreciate that you're willing
to open up like that.

380
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,885
Yeah.

381
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,679
<i>♪ All I want is you to know ♪</i>

382
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,265
<i>♪ The difference you have made ♪</i>

383
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,561
<i>♪ Please, don't change ♪</i>

384
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,441
With Barnett, it's just so weird,
and it's getting hard,

385
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,152
because I'm having conversations
that I'm literally, like,

386
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,964
I'm talking to him, and I was like,
"If we do this, if we're together,

387
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,156
there's something I wanna do,

388
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,079
as husband and wife, like, this is
what I want to do in a relationship."

389
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,642
Like talking, like when this works,

390
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,455
- I want us to get a couple's massage...
- Yeah.

391
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,423
In my mind,
it's not even a question.

392
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,622
- What's not a question?
- Like...

393
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,419
that we would be a couple.

394
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,712
It's not a question.

395
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,174
I know the other girls
have feelings for Barnett, but...

396
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,218
it's Barnett or bust,

397
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,511
for me at this point.

398
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,738
These girls will be at my wedding.

399
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,531
There's gonna be a wedding,
and they'll be there.

400
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,140
I'm sorry, it's gonna happen.

401
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,892
So, sucks to be them.

402
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,060
He doesn't approach it,

403
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,145
or the way that he responds to it
is not like...

404
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,023
It's not like a weird way like,
"Oh, yeah, 'if'..."

405
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109
He doesn't accentuate it,
he was like, "Yeah.

406
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,394
When we get through this,
we'll get a couples massage."

407
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,987
That sounds pretty affirmative.

408
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,906
Like, all my cards are on the table.

409
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,243
I literally have nothing left to play.
Just waiting for him to make the moves.

410
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,326
Mm-hmm.

411
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,079
Hearing Amber talk about Barnett,

412
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,872
doesn't really phase me.

413
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,500
I know what Barnett and I have is special,

414
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,919
and totally different
from what he has with her,

415
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,004
because we always talk about

416
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,923
what life would be like after this,

417
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,092
and it's kind of a secret between us

418
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,719
that we're going to end up
together in this.

419
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,930
The easy stuff comes so easy.

420
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,599
It's just Barnett or bust,

421
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,683
that's it for me.

422
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,352
Yeah.

423
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,485
We have two weeks to figure out

424
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,904
who we're going to spend
the rest of our lives with.

425
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,322
I've got three people left.

426
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,200
Jessica, Amber, and LC,

427
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,412
they all would make excellent wives,

428
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,497
and it's difficult because

429
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,834
I'm becoming emotionally attached
to all of them

430
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,126
in different ways.

431
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,378
What's up, LC?

432
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,315
Do you really think
that you can find a wife?

433
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,634
What do you think?

434
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,802
Don't do that.

435
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,846
We don't have time for games here.

436
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,890
The thing with Barnett is,

437
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,309
we can paint
a really good picture together, like...

438
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,227
what this would actually be like,

439
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,563
what an actual life with each other
would look like.

440
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,025
I'm just really pumped to see
what happens the next few days.

441
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,111
Why do you think you could marry me?

442
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,780
I don't know, I've always
envisioned myself with a guy

443
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,450
similar to my dad in the way he like...

444
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,036
- Oh, gosh.
- ...he's a people person,

445
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,995
everybody loves him.

446
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,497
How do you imagine
I would do with your parents?

447
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,392
- I think you'd be good with my parents.
- Yeah?

448
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,919
I don't know if Barnett
will propose to anyone,

449
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,213
but I feel like if he did,

450
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,714
I think that it would be me.

451
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,090
Okay, real quick,

452
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,174
whenever I propose,

453
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,678
What do you think about
non-diamond rings?

454
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,014
- Oh, yeah. I love that.
- Really?

455
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:24,973
Okay.

456
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,934
Alright, well, you gotta do it.

457
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,476
Yeah?

458
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,727
Yep.

459
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,939
With LC,
we're very freaking similar,

460
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,317
and it's like, what's going on here?
Like, why are we so alike?

461
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,153
It's like figuring out
if I want to marry myself

462
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,321
in girl version.

463
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,488
So...

464
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,742
With Amber, she excites me,

465
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,870
but she also scares
the living hell out of me.

466
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,872
When we get out of here,

467
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,375
we're going to be all, like,
engaged and shit.

468
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,668
"We're all gonna be engaged"?

469
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,812
You're talking in general,
or you and me are gonna be engaged?

470
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,671
Me and you.

471
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,673
Are you proposing to me now?
Is that a thing?

472
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,593
No, I'm not going to propose you tonight.

473
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,391
If I don't propose to Amber,

474
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,018
she's going to find me outside of here
and whoop my ass!

475
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,644
Hey, B.

476
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,895
Hey, girl.

477
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,148
I think Jessica
is my number one,

478
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,733
because every time I talk to her,

479
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,278
there's like mad goosebumps.

480
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,173
I told her I was ready
to get married,

481
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,907
and I would choose her if I could.

482
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,618
If this place had no other guys,

483
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,620
and no other girls,

484
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,207
I would propose to you tomorrow.

485
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,291
You would?

486
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,378
You are my yin to my yang.

487
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,130
I am so fucking happy right now.

488
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,425
Jessica, Amber and LC...

489
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,011
I love everything about these girls,

490
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,514
but all in different ways, and I'm like,
"What the hell am I supposed to do?"

491
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,516
You got it? You getting married?

492
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,518
No. Not yet.

493
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,853
- Not yet?
- Not yet.

494
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,187
What you doing?

495
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,249
- I'm just a little nervous.
- Nervous of what?

496
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,150
My relationship with Barnett, like...

497
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,987
- went somewhere I've never really felt.
- Really?

498
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,488
I've never felt before.

499
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,366
We just started to talk really seriously,

500
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,579
and he started talking in the context
of being my husband,

501
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,956
and I started to visualize it.

502
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,542
I've waited so long for, like,

503
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,004
someone that I care about so much
to say those things,

504
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,589
and to feel that way.

505
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,591
He said he would marry me.

506
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,717
Oh, wow.

507
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,512
I had an awkward moment
with Barnett,

508
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,806
and I just never gave him another chance.

509
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,309
He pretty much associated my name

510
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,894
with being a stripper,

511
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,897
and so when girls be mentioning him,
I'll be like, "Oh my God.

512
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,024
What is it?" I'm like,
I couldn't stand him.

513
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,192
Like, ugh.

514
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,528
And then, like, I know
the feelings that I have for Mark,

515
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,531
and it's just a totally
different relationship. Like, it's...

516
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,408
amazing on so many levels.

517
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,492
Mm-hmm.

518
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,246
Jessica, since the first day
you walked out that pod,

519
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,373
and you was like, "Girl."

520
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,664
I said, "What?"

521
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,042
"I like Mark."

522
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,418
And I'm like, "Oh!"

523
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,587
Just know, if you're asking me my advice,

524
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:05,425
I prefer for you to be with Mark.

525
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,511
I'm nervous about Mark, though.

526
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,263
My relationship with Barnett,

527
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,058
and my relationship with Mark
are totally separate,

528
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,352
like "on another planet" type
relationships.

529
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,895
You know, I always thought...

530
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,691
my relationship with Barnett was just
a flirtatious situation.

531
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:22,984
And now that it's

532
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,528
developing into more,

533
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,947
I have to see what happens with Barnett.

534
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,574
I have to follow my heart with Barnett.

535
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,792
It's a breath of fresh air

536
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,211
to be accepted by Jessica for just me.

537
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,713
Not what I look like,

538
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,509
not how I move, or my body, or whatever.

539
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,636
It's like she's accepting me for me.

540
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,264
And now I know what a true relationship
looks like.

541
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,182
You know, I ask you...

542
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,999
you know, do you want to spend
the rest of your life with me?

543
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,020
Like... where's your mind at?

544
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,314
I can definitely...

545
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,027
see us walking out of here together.

546
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,612
I really can.

547
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,030
It's kind of weird to say that.

548
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,283
That's what I'm talking about!

549
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,202
I think Jessica and I,

550
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,328
will be getting married.

551
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,037
So what's up?

552
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,415
I'm sad right now.

553
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,832
Why?

554
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,502
Because I don't like
this situation anymore.

555
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,546
What are you talking about?

556
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,923
I feel like I'd rather
just walk away from this.

557
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,008
This is crazy.

558
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,677
So many people are going to get hurt
in this, you know?

559
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,390
I don't want you to like, hurt.

560
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,309
Why... What are you talking about?

561
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,270
Obviously since day one, I've been like,

562
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,980
Mark, Mark, Mark.

563
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,773
That's just been it, you know?

564
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,609
You know, our connection is so strong,

565
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,196
but I would be doing myself a disservice
if I didn't...

566
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,366
pursue relationships
like I came here to do.

567
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,950
What the fuck?

568
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,330
I get it, you want to weigh out
all your options and be certain.

569
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,500
I am certain. You were certain
when you walked out yesterday.

570
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,670
I definitely don't want to jump the gun,
you know?

571
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,795
It's just the experience for me
has been different.

572
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,674
It's worked in different ways for me.

573
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,761
And I don't just care about you, like I...

574
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,304
I love you, like, it's crazy.

575
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,181
All the other dates I've had,

576
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,308
I didn't feel like that.

577
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,145
The reason why I'm so passionate right now
is because I feel that towards you,

578
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,398
but if you're feeling that
with someone else, it's like...

579
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,901
I will... I'm going to be open
and honest with you.

580
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:28,984
Okay.

581
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,904
You're ten years younger than I am.

582
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,198
Like, it's, it's...

583
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,367
crazy.

584
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,495
Like I have created
other connections that...

585
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,207
look like they could potentially
plug into my life, you know?

586
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,006
I'm just trying to, like,
explore everything,

587
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,175
because we only have a
limited amount of time

588
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,540
and it's like the rest of our lives,
you know what I mean?

589
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,896
It feels like I'm an option,
that's what it makes me feel like.

590
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,022
God...

591
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,775
I told you how certain I am.

592
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,528
I've never been this certain
about something in my life.

593
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,697
I'm going to tell you straight up.

594
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,049
If I'm not walking out of here with you,

595
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,913
then I'll go my separate way,
and I'll go home.

596
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,387
And that's fine.
I'm just letting you know where I stand,

597
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,121
and that the ball's in your court,

598
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,455
and that's all I'm saying.

599
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,217
I came into this wanting
to find someone,

600
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,969
but I didn't know that

601
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,852
I was going to have to hurt
someone else, too.

602
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:42,851
So I think that's wearing on me
more than anything.

603
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,649
Oh, fuck me!

604
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,199
Yesterday, I felt like we both knew
that we were going to walk

605
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,618
- out of here together.
- Yeah.

606
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,245
Today, having conversations, as you said,

607
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,497
I'm just like, "So you're playing me?

608
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,499
So you're still weighing your options,

609
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,751
- or what's up?"
- Yeah.

610
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,478
Because that's the problem.

611
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,629
Because, like,

612
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,464
I'm not just a fucking option.

613
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,799
I don't need my partner,

614
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,384
age difference or not,

615
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,804
to expect me to be a 34 year old.

616
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,888
I'm 24.

617
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,223
I know what I am.

618
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,516
I feel as though

619
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,602
I put my heart out there, and someone

620
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,770
reciprocated it,

621
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,533
but then just ripped it out for no reason.

622
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,814
Don't fuck with me.

623
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,566
- Don't fuck with me.
- Yeah.

624
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,794
- I'm a grown-ass man.
- Yeah.

625
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,258
- I know what I fucking want.
- Yeah.

626
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,448
Oh, fuck me.

627
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,004
I'm about to see

628
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,256
the man of my dreams for the first time.

629
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,384
He assured me that

630
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,344
I will always make him happy,
no matter what.

631
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,888
I just hope that he accepts me

632
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,306
for who I am.

633
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,684
I'm here for you, Carlton.

634
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,103
I will always be here for you,
no matter what.

635
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,820
Oh, my gosh.

636
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,660
I didn't tell Diamond
about my past

637
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,994
before the proposal,

638
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:29,124
because I just always wanted
people to judge me

639
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,458
for the way that I love,

640
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,335
rather than who I love,

641
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,214
and a lot of times, people are misjudged
when they're fluid.

642
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,341
So, of course in the back of my mind,

643
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,136
I'm thinking, well, what if
she has a change of heart?

644
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,266
When we finally meet,
I just hope that I make him smile.

645
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,560
And I hope that

646
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,645
he just finds me very attractive, and...

647
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,315
will swoop me up and take me off.

648
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,284
How are you?

649
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,745
Hi!

650
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,417
Oh, my God.

651
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,589
Oh, wow.

652
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,550
How are you?

653
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,469
- I'm good, how you feeling?
- Good.

654
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,013
Oh my gosh.

655
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,348
I'm a fiancée!

656
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,975
Can you believe it?

657
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:29,976
Look at you.

658
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:30,977
Look at<i> you!</i>

659
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,979
Look at <i>you.</i> You fly.

660
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,481
<i>- You</i> fly.
- You look good.

661
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,564
Thank you.

662
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,233
- Damn.
- I was hoping you'd like it.

663
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,152
I know that I'm different.

664
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,780
I know that my past is different.

665
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,908
But this is what I've always dreamed of.

666
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,118
In four weeks, we'll be getting married.

667
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,412
My biggest worry is that

668
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,080
someone that I am super in love with

669
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,332
and want to marry,

670
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,626
won't be able to walk down the aisle,

671
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,170
because she just can't be married
to someone like me.

672
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,798
I'm excited about my marriage.

673
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,050
- I am.
- You are?

674
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,133
Mm-hmm.

675
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,969
You ready to get this party started?

676
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,137
I am.

677
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,972
It's going to be great.

678
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,977
I love guys with bald heads,

679
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,979
and I think I like the way he dressed,

680
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,397
and just his whole persona.

681
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,399
I'm very attracted to Carlton.

682
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,402
Whoo!

683
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,487
Thank you, God.

684
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,050
When I was talking to him,
expressing my heart to him,

685
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,159
I wanted to know, like,
are you here for me?

686
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,911
Are you going to accept my flaws?

687
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,623
Carlton has a way of making me feel

688
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,417
like I'm the only woman on Earth.

689
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,586
He really, truly, loves me.

690
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,005
As of right now, the only concern

691
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,757
will have to be our family.

692
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,802
Hopefully our family can accept

693
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,427
our love,

694
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,722
and the way it went down.

695
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,349
This is not normal.

696
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,852
I know a lot of families are traditional.

697
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,936
They want you to date,

698
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,563
become the girlfriend...

699
00:30:56,646 --> 00:31:00,233
We're not oblivious to the steps
and the process of marriage,

700
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,110
but it's not their life.

701
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,154
It's my life, and I choose

702
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,990
to be with Carlton.

703
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,837
You should be proud about the fact
that so many girls like you.

704
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,423
You are a catch, my brother.

705
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,675
Who have you talked the most with

706
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,218
on serious issues?

707
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,846
- Amber.
- Amber.

708
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,763
Probably Amber.

709
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,973
What about Jessica?

710
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,935
I think we shoot the shit way too much
when we're in there,

711
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,563
and it's hard to get past that sometimes.

712
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,899
Why was she your number one last night?

713
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,668
Like, the feeling in the moment.

714
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,194
I mean, that's my problem
with every relationship,

715
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,738
every person that I talk to,

716
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,531
I get in there,
I want to have a good time.

717
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,700
How do you feel
about you and LC, on paper?

718
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,887
I think we would always have
a good time.

719
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,496
But I think that because
we're so similar,

720
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,206
You're in the honeymoon phase, right?

721
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,666
And you love talking to them,

722
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,168
love being around them, but...

723
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,879
our job here is not to be
in the honeymoon phase,

724
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,965
our job here is to find someone
that we spend the rest our life with.

725
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,841
And that's important,

726
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,635
but...

727
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,013
Yeah, man. I hope you find some clarity.

728
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,435
- Hello?
- Hi.

729
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,770
Hey, how are you?

730
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,188
Good, how are you?

731
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,481
Hello?

732
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,024
Hi.

733
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,107
Hey.

734
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,070
I've waited so long

735
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,780
to find the perfect person,

736
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,199
and I think Barnett

737
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,162
is someone I can
spend the rest of my life with.

738
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,620
I'm ready for him to ask me

739
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,037
to marry him.

740
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,749
What are you doing?

741
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,584
Drinking red wine.

742
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,462
Let's do some fun stuff.

743
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,157
- I wanna have fun.
- Okay, what do you wanna do?

744
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,633
Um...

745
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,718
Twenty questions? Truth or dare?

746
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,095
Truth or dare.

747
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,180
Is it true that...

748
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,017
you still feel the same way
you felt last night

749
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,309
about me?

750
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,775
I don't know.

751
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,195
Wait, really?

752
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,739
- Yeah.
- Oh.

753
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,365
Okay.

754
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,036
Ah!

755
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,205
Jessica would be a good wife.

756
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,375
but after my dates with Amber and LC,

757
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,336
I'm scared to have to pick

758
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,629
between any of these girls,

759
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,424
because I know all the
qualities that they have,

760
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,094
and all the good things
that can come from each person, you know?

761
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,559
I don't know what's up in my mind.

762
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,519
I know I have connections,

763
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,604
emotional connections with people.

764
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,274
And I don't know how

765
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,816
to, like...

766
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,361
differentiate feeling good

767
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,612
from, you know...

768
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,867
feeling the L-word, almost.

769
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,290
Okay.

770
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,500
- I feel like I should go.
- Why?

771
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,584
Because...

772
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,879
I don't fuck with people like you.

773
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,213
What does that mean?

774
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,258
Like, I'm not playing this game with you.

775
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:13,926
I'm not trying play games,

776
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,262
I'm trying to feel everything out
right now.

777
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,282
- I'm trying to be rational.
- Well, why...

778
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,492
I don't know why you said
everything you said to me, then.

779
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,268
What are you trying to figure out?

780
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,936
My freaking heart, man.

781
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,605
Your heart? About what?

782
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,399
I just don't know what it's feeling.

783
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,568
- I'm trying so hard...
- Oh, my gosh. Stop.

784
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,155
I don't know what's going on.

785
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,161
Now you're trying to figure it out?

786
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,080
I know a million guys like you.

787
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,831
That's a load of shit.

788
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,043
There's people that don't know
what they want, and that's you.

789
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,286
You don't know what you want.

790
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,856
- A million people have told me.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

791
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,880
Okay, then you can try to do it
with somebody else,

792
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,842
- because I'm fucking over this.
- Okay.

793
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,929
You told me last night
that you were ready to propose to me.

794
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,138
That's insane.

795
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,475
You literally said that last night.

796
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,643
I like you.

797
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,980
I'm not even entertaining
this conversation.

798
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,315
This is embarrassing.

799
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,275
Okay.

800
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,501
Bye, Jessica.

801
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,046
Fuck.

802
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,093
<i>♪ Say you hate, say you hate me ♪</i>

803
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,263
<i>♪ Just say some
Just say something ♪</i>

804
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,016
Being married is the next step
in the rest of my life, and it's...

805
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,894
If I don't start now,

806
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,939
who's to say that I'm ever
going to find someone?

807
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,525
Like, any of these girls.

808
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,486
I look like a freaking fool.

809
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,865
I have all these conversations
with someone,

810
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,241
and then tell them how I feel.

811
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,534
I tell them that, you know...

812
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,870
like, they're strong in my mind, and...

813

814

816
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,175
<i>Jessica, how you feeling, friend?</i>

817
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,968
Don't let that dude fuck with you.

818
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,720
- What?
- Don't let Barnett fuck with you.

819
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,803
What do you mean?

820
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,807
I'm just telling you, he's a fuckboy.

821
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,642
I just walked out on him.

822
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,312
- Who'd you walk out on?
- How so?

823
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,395
What do you mean?

824
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,023
He's been telling me

825
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,482
a lot of things.

826
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,651
He told me he's going to
propose to me, last night.

827
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,445
He told me he wanted to propose to me,

828
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,654
and make me his wife,

829
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,823
and he just told me tonight...

830
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,907
I was like...

831
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,369
That's what set me back,
I'm like, "What the hell?"

832
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,372
He is a total dick.

833
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,249
He doesn't know what he wants,

834
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,625
period.

835
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,588
What just happened is is really kind of
earth-shattering for me.

836
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,008
Your relationship with him
may be different, but I think...

837
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,509
I know, but it gets to the point...

838
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,636
I know, I know.

839
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,488
Do not let him fucking make you look

840
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,639
like he just made me look.

841
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,600
I told her last night that I was, like...

842
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,186
considering proposing to her, almost,

843
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,857
and like, I feel fucking ridiculous
and stupid as shit for saying that shit.

844
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,611
Like, I'm not trying to be an asshole.

845
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,949
It's just, I can't help my ability
to connect with people,

846
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:26,160
and that there's multiple people
that I connect with.

847
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,330
I don't know.

848
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,750
Again, I still strongly believe
that everyone's relationship is different.

849
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,085
Maybe he's having issues,

850
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,230
but he told me tonight
that he doesn't know what he wants,

851
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,505
and he's fucked up in his head.

852
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,631
That's what he told me.

853
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,802
After telling me he was literally...

854
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,885
What?

855
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,348
After last night, literally telling me
he was gonna marry me.

856
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:54,021
Maybe it was less of a serious,

857
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,231
"Will you marry me?"

858
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,817
and more of a off-handed,

859
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,986
"Yeah, I would marry you tomorrow,"

860
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,238
which I guess she took

861
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,448
more seriously than he did.

862
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,117
So...

863
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,868
I don't know.

864
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,380

Hello.

869
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,516
I'm pissed,

870
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,936
because I had visualized

871
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,148
Barnett as someone I could spend
the rest of my life with.

872
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,318
Yesterday, I was thinking,
"Mark, Mark, Mark,"

873
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,112
and Barnett came
and distracted me with this game.

874
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,072
So I really hope that

875
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,741
I didn't mess it up with Mark.

876
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,701
He is just everything,

877
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,911
everything I've ever wanted,

878
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,163
and so much more.

879
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,288
What's up?

880
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,463
I'm so sorry. I feel like such an asshole.

881
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,884
I just, like...
I don't know, I feel like I had to think.

882
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,263
I didn't know what was happening.

883
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,474
I swear, though, like,

884
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,517
it was him, like,

885
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,894
I swear to God.

886
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,853
It wasn't me.

887
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,647
Now I'm just like...

888
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,732
I don't know...

889
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,488
Babe, I was so confused, you know?

890
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,910
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

891
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,537
It's cut off.

892
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,498
Like, it is totally cut off.

893
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,999
I'm not seeing him anymore.

894
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,087
Barnett is definitely not what I want.

895
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,426
Baby, I don't want to date anybody else.

896
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,265
I know my worth, like a thousand percent.

897
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,810
Like, I know who I am.

898
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,311
I know what I bring to the table,

899
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,397
and I know everything I'm worth.

900
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,817
And I'm not second fiddle.

901
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,361
Look, I'm real.

902
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,155
I'm not some dude,
acting like I'm something I'm not.

903
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,075
One of the things my mom always taught me

904
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,494
growing up, is that
when you love something,

905
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,246
and you let it go,

906
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,706
if it comes back, it was always for you.

907
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,143
If it doesn't come back,
it was never for you in the first place.

908
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,043
And I could feel it.

909
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:21,961
She was like, "Babe."

910
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,130
She said "babe" like a thousand times
after that.

911
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,967
Jessica's finally telling me
what I've always wanted,

912
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,262
and I don't know how to how to take it.

913
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,848
It's like I just can't wrap my head
around it.

914
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,600
Now, I always want you to be
100% transparent with me.

915
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,684
Yeah.

916
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,813
And so,
I want you to know that, like...

917
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,899
I do care about you.

918
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,693
And I get it.

919
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,820
There's a lot of societal shit, whatever,

920
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,613
and there's a lot of, you know,

921
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,407
shit that we would have to combat.

922
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,870
- Yeah.
- We just don't know what's gonna happen.

923
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,832
I've taken a step back
a little bit from Mark,

924
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,352
and letting him know if there
are connections with other people,

925
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,504
and I wouldn't blame him
for wanting to take a step back from me.

926
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,340
Now I don't know if I'm going to
end up with anyone.

932
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,158
The "physical and emotional gauntlet"
is what I've called it.

933
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,202
It's overwhelming,
but in all the best ways.

934
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,496
I honestly don't believe

935
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,498
that if, had I not gone
through this process,

936

I would have found the woman
of Kelly's caliber,

937
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,710
in the real world.

938
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,593
I know that I found
someone that I can trust,

939
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,512
and that's the biggest thing.

940
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,724
And she can rely and trust in me forever.

941
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,812
- Milady.
- HI.

942
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,355
How are you today?

943
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,191
- I'm great.
- You're great?

944
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,526
- Yeah.
- I can tell.

945
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,860
Yeah.

946
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,696
I've appreciated this journey
with you.

947
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,090
I know that I need to be with you,

948
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,700
and you're exactly the person
that I've been looking for.

949
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,912
And I'm going to go ahead...

950
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,121
I'm going to cover my eyes,

951
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,375
because I kind of want to
just black every single thing out...

952
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,044
...and just be with you in this moment.

953
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,605
- Okay.
- Can you do that, too?

954
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,548
- Yep, I will close my eyes.
- Okay.

955
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,426
I'm going to go ahead
and get down on my knee.

956
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,137
Mm-hmm.

957
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,139
And I'm going to ask you, Kelly Marie,

958
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,141
will you marry me?

959
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,020
I will, yes.

960
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,315
Oh, my God.

961
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,401
Are you excited?

962
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,986
- Yeah.
- I am so pumped.

963
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,031
I love you today,
and that love will remain,

964
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,493
but I can't wait to learn
to love you even more.

965
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,577
I love you, too.

966
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,290
It's so surreal.

967
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,669
I don't know how to even describe

968
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,472
the thoughts that are going
through my mind.

969
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,215
I've found someone who...

970
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,928
I've worked so hard to think of
and dream of in my head.

971
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,012
Oh, my gosh.

972
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,598
You are just this...

973
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,850
perfect person

974
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,685
on the other side of this wall,

975
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,353
and I cannot wait to meet you

976
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,938
and touch you.

977
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,022
Oh, my gosh.

978
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,567
I have longed for this for so long,

979
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,943
and I just feel like

980
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,653
he has been my missing link.

981
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,155
like having that companion,

982
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,948
and it's just, like, complete right now.

983
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,658
Um, I can't wait to see you.

984
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,094
I can't wait to see you either.

985
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,678
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

986

Oh-oh.

00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,299

Hello?

993
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,350
It feels so good
to hear your voice again.

994
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:08,228
- Yeah.
- So, something, seemed like in your past,

995
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,356
or something has happened
that has caused you

996
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,857
to feel that you're not beautiful.

997
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,400
Why is that such a fear for you?

998
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,153
Because I feel like there's so many
beautiful things about you.

999
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,658
Well...

1000
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,125
I guess moving here, like,

1001
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,251
America,

1002
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,547
I was different,

1003
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,718
you know, and then I got picked on
a lot in high school,

1004
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,180
and for some reason
I just felt inadequate.

1005
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:46,849
This is hard...

1006
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,851
for me.

1007
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,481
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

1008
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,902
Hearing you talk is just, like...

1009
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,405
I got picked on a lot in school, too.

1010
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,240
I got made fun of.

1011
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,075
I was tiny and small,

1012
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,243
you know, I was...

1013
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,787
quirky and weird, I guess.

1014
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,164
And it really took years

1015
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,875
after high school to figure out who I am

1016
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,711
and what kind of man I wanted to become.

1017
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,339
You know, everybody's had something
in their past,

1018
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,383
but, like, you've got to love yourself,

1019
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,884
and you got to trust,

1020
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,845
and let other people love you
for who you are.

1021
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,263
And if they can't, then,

1022
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,348
in simple terms, I just say, screw 'em.

1023
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,558
Mm-hmm.

1024
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,476
Are you "uh-huh"-ing,
or are you humming?

1025
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,936
I'm "uh-huh"-ing.

1026
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,188
Uh-huh.

I have definitely thought about

1029
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:53,625
because I do want him to
love me on the outside, too,

1030
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,920
even though we've connected

She and I didn't share any descriptions
of each other.

1036
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,704
I can just tell that she's
such a gentle person,

1037
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,773
and to me that means so much more
than just, you know,

1038
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,691
some other physical characteristic.

She's beautiful. She's perfect.

1042
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,140
She's a little, you know,
5'2", short thing.

1043
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,226
I can just bundle her up,

1044
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,728
and she just buried herself in my chest,

1045
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,105
and it's like we've known each other
our entire lives.

I'm so excited.

00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,274
I'm ready.

1048
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,234
Yeah? Good.

1049
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,317
- Yeah.
- Good.

1050

Kenny and I got to know each other

1051
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,824
on such an emotional level,

1052
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,742
because we couldn't see each other.

1053
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,828
And the physical attraction
was there, too.

1054
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,454
I mean it was in tenfold,

1055
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,374
because I know what makes him who he is.

1056
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,252
And he's just so beautiful inside and out.

1057
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,421
I'm so excited for the next few weeks,

1058
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:22,923
and hopefully

1059
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,634
the rest of our lives together.

1060
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:35,811
Hello?

1061
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:36,728
Hi.

1062
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,981
I, like, really miss that voice.

1063
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,690
It's really crazy.

1064
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,151
After our talk yesterday,

1065
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,820
I went to bed thinking about you,

1066
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,823
and when I woke up, you were
the first thing I thought of this morning.

1067
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,075
It's scary to have
this amount of emotions, so fast.

1068
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,660
And it's not like me.

1069
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,538
I don't, like...
I don't get attached quick.

1070
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,499
That's the same thing
with me, too, but...

1071
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,629
something that is kind of like
in the back of my head...

1072
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,425
is that I self-sabotage

1073
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,843
all the time.

1074
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,930
But I realize that I do it

1075
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,641
when something that's
too good to be true

1076
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,935
is happening to me.

1077
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,730
Because my parents' divorce
really fucked me up.

1078
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,941
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

1079
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,527
this is something that
I've always been afraid of.

1080
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,072
<i>I can picture my life
with and without Damian.</i>

1081
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,660
But my life is so much sweeter
with him in it.

1082
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,538
I don't want to picture
my life without him.

1083
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,749
I mean, I'm scared, but...

1084
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,172
I know you don't wanna get hurt,
as much as I don't wanna get hurt,

1085
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,342
and I feel really strongly about you
and the way things are going,

1086
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,011
and I think I could really
see something with you.

1087
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,094
Mm-hmm?

1088
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:55,849
Am I falling in love?

1089
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:56,933
Am I in love?

1090
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,853
I want the answer to be "yes."

1091
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:04,483
I feel such a strong connection
with her right now, and...

1092
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,944
it's unbelievable,

1093
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,363
but there's always
that fear of losing her,

1094
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,572
and it's a scary thing.

1095
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,533
But I feel right now, we've built
such a strong bond,

1096
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,328
that I'm willing to stay here
to find out if she is my true love.

1097
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,705
Thank you...

1098
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,331
so much.

1099
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,626
I'm the one
that should be thanking you.

1100
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,176
Feels like I've been here for months.

1101
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,222
I'm drained, just emotionally drained
right now.

1102
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,057
Last night was really rough

1103
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,183
with Jessica,

1104
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:41,269
and I'm scared to only have
a couple days.

1105
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,021
I just hope for happiness.

1106
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,898
That's all I see, is just like

1107
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,526
whoever I'm with,
just smiling all the time,

1108
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,361
and making them smile,

1109
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,156
and, like, me smiling too, obviously.

1110
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,951
Because I just want a good life.

1111
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,036
- Hey.
- Hi!

1112
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,808
What are you getting into over there?

1113
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,790
- Oh, I brought my ukulele.
- Oh!

1114
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,917
You play the ukulele?

1115
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,961
I wanted it to be surprising.

1116
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,644
Are you about to serenade me?

1117
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,983
- Did you write me a song?
- I wrote you a song, it's called

1118
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,591
<i>♪ LC ♪</i>

1119
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,803
<i>♪ Is my favorite initials ♪</i>

1120
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,682
Okay.

1121
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,977
Every single person here, guy or girl,

1122
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,782
has gotten to a point
where they're like...

1123
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,313
All of us are like,

1124
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,457
"I wanna marry this person."

1125
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,025
And we've known them for a week.

1126
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,708
I've gotten on a level here
that I've not even gotten with myself,

1127
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,196
much less another person.

1128
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,741
But now I'm already way past anything

1129
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,409
with Barnett emotionally,

1130
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,328
and I don't even care what he looks like.

1131
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,956
I never thought I would say that.

1132
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,268
- That's the only part I know.
- Were you ever in choir?

1133
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,544
- Was I ever in choir? No.
- Really?

1134
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,422
No, I get my singing practice
in the shower.

1135
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,733
- Oh.
- It's like where I...

1136
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,216
That's where you really turn it up?

1137
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,460
Where I turn it up.

1138
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,589
Yeah, like my dog sits outside
and looks at me weird.

1139
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,514
See, I don't live by myself,
so for me it's the car.

1140
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,476
Yeah,
I like to make up my own songs

1141
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,870
- while I'm driving to work.
- Me, too.

1142
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,021
And I sing to them in the car,
and I'm like,

1143
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,355
why does this sound so good?

1144
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,275
I mean, I should get a record deal,
right now.

1145
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,070
LC, I like you.

1146
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,782
Yeah, you're the kind of guy
I could definitely fall for really quickly

1147
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,384
and know that I would have
a lot of fun with,

1148
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,494
which is my most important thing, always.

1149
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,347
That's what I was thinking, you know,

1150
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,998
we're so alike, it's ridiculous.

1151
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,875
And we like a lot of the same stuff.

1152
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,835
What's a song you know
on the ukulele?

1153
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,212
Nothing, I don't know any songs.

1154
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,546
Okay, well, all right.

1155
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,381
- Let's just...
- You like Taylor Swift?

1156
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,716
I love Taylor Swift.

1157
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,218
I don't know any Taylor Swift.

1158
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,571
I was just asking,
because I like Taylor Swift.

1159
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,795
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

1160
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,181
Have you been to her concert?

1161
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,242
If she was in this, she would be
the person I'd be marrying.

1162
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,266
Me, too.

1163
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,853
So what you're saying is...

1164
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,647
What I'm saying is...

1165
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,942
Taylor, if you're watching,
and I end up single after this,

1166
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,652
Okay.

1167
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,904
I haven't been vulnerable in a long time,

1168
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,198
and I haven't been open in a long time
with anybody.

1169
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,200
It makes me feel good to know that

1170
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,286
someone on the other side
of that wall cares about me.

1171
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,920
How real has this shit got?

1172
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,190
So real, I didn't realize
some of the issues that I have

1173
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,382
were still issues for me.

1174
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,465
Open up, girl.

1175
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,552
Fuck, where do I start?

1176
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,345
My...

1177
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,099
one and only serious relationship.

1178
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,226
This is going to be my future husband.

1179
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,519
Like, I told him,

1180
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,021
"I think I might be pregnant,"

1181
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,149
and immediately he's in

1182
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,192
problem-solving mode.

1183
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,986
"Well, how are we going to fix this?"

1184
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,444
Like...

1185
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,905
it wasn't...

1186
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,865
Oh, God. I just...

1187
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,868
No, I got you. I know where you're at.

1188
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:43,951
I know what's going on.

1189
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,454
I don't have kids right now.

1190
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:50,250
So obviously I didn't follow
through with the pregnancy.

1191
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,252
It was the...

1192
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,377
Oh, fuck.

1193
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,398
- It was...
- Yeah, you're okay. You're okay.

1194
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,422
It was...

1195
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,678
It was really the hardest thing
I've ever gone through in my life.

1196
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,356
I was still learning what it meant
to be in love with somebody,

1197
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,817
and because I loved him so much,

1198
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,153
I... I had an abortion.

1199
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,321
Uh...

1200
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,033
Shit.

1201
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,747
It's not exactly something that's like...

1202
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,124
I'm proud of.

1203
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,877
After the fact, we were just talking.

1204
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,086
I'm telling him, like...

1205
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,672
I'm trying to explain
what I'm going through, like,

1206
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,467
I'm having a really hard time
getting out of bed in the morning.

1207
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,593
I don't eat.

1208
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,803
I'm not really sleeping. I just...

1209
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,433
This was supposed to be my other half.
And his reaction, he goes,

1210
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,621
"Why don't you just get over it?

1211
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,725
You just need to get over it already.
Like, move on."

1212
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,608
That is the last thing in the world
you want to hear.

1213
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,819
I need to know if a situation
like that comes up,

1214
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,905
and an unexpected pregnancy happens,

1215
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,323
I'm not going to be...

1216
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,702
I won't be forced to choose.

1217
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,872
I can't survive that again.
Like, I just...

1218
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,832
I... It would destroy me.

1219
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,775
Deep breath in.

1220
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,237
Force the air out.

1221
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,202
For the first time my life,
I know what I want.

1222
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,286
I want her.

1223
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,791
It scares the shit out of me.

1224
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,462
When you're in love, you know,
it's scary, right?

1225
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,170
It's something that's powerful.

1226
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,674
As guys, we're taught that
we are supposed to be in control,

1227
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,426
and for this, you're not.

1228
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,219
I am nervous,

1229
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,511
anxious,

1230
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,056
because when it comes to Giannina,

1231
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,226
I'm afraid that she'll get scared,

1232
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,936
and maybe leave,

1233
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,148
because she gets scared when

1234
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,816
things are too good to be true,

1235
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,027
and when things start to become
real to her.

1236
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,653
She seems to pull away.

1237
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,322
I am going to propose today.

1238
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,405
You ready for this?

1239
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,574
I'm ready.

1240
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,454
I have fallen in love

1241
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,165
with who Giannina is as a person,

1242
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,000
and it is so much more beautiful

1243
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,294
than just basing somebody off their looks.

1244
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,175
Giannina, I love you with all my heart.

1245
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,010
Thank you for coming into my life,

1246
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,596
and letting me know what it means to live.

1247
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,776
Hello.

1248
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:03,942
Hi.

1249
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,321
How you feeling?

1250
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:07,905
Good.

1251
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,824
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1252
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,250
I would love to hear
your name again.

1253
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,285
Your full name.

1254
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,829
My full name...

1255
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,831
is Giannina...

1256
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:18,333
Milady...

1257
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,126
Gibelli.

1258
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,460
Giannina...

1259
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,129
Milady...

1260
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,213
Gibelli.

1261
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,049
- Bingo.
- Hence, "GG."

1262
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:29,010
- Hence, "GG."
- So I want to tell you...

1263
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,138
I've been...

1264
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,432
figuring out what

1265
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,518
makes Giannina tick,

1266
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,937
and I wanted to give you something

1267
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,105
that meant something to me.

1268
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,690
And I start putting things in this box,

1269
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,616
things from other countries,
places I've been,

1270
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,944
and things I just...

1271
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,278
That say it's Damian.

1272
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,364
Did you get the box?

1273
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,735
- This is my thoughts, my memories.
- Okay.

1274
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,824
And when you open the box,
what do you see?

1275
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,579
Empty.

1276
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,747
It's empty,

1277
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,875
because I stopped.

1278
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,377
I was like, this isn't right.

1279
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,713
Besides my brother and my family,

1280
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,384
you've now become the most important
thing in my life,

1281
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,095
and I cannot put you in that box.

1282
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,389
So I took the bow off the box.

1283
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,016
And I put the bow on my right hand,

1284
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,145
because today I don't just give you
a piece of me,

1285
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,479
I give you all of me.

1286
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,731
I am your gift.

1287
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:25,942
Giannina,

1288
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,862
I love everything about you.

1289
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,367
Giannina Milady...

1290
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,827
Gibelli.

1291
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,330
Before you,

1292
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,417
I get on one knee
for the first time in my life,

1293
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,170
and I ask you to take this bow.

1294
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:49,757
I ask you,

1295
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,468
will you marry me?

1296
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,722
Mm.

1297
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,625
I wanted
to tell you something...
