1
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,200
<i>I've never actually dated anyone</i>
<i>in the past.</i>

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,240
<i>I've been dreaming about marriage
for years, ever since I left school.</i>

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,920
<i>I do feel like I'm ready.</i>

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,160
You all right?

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Little nervous.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,000
Just butterflies.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,760
She won't see it there.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
- Hey!
- Hello, Amanda.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,760
- How are you?
- Oh, please, allow me.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,320
- Thank you.
- I'm...

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,440
- How have you been?
- I'm good. How are you?

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,680
I'm very good as well.

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
And, um...

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
this is for you.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,800
Oh!

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,720
I love flowers.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,280
- You do?
- Yes.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,160
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,800
You know, I used to study flowers.

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,080
- I never knew that.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Hmm.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,720
So, um, what's been happening?

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,360
- Been working.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,920
Pretty sure. What have you been up to?

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,480
Not a lot, just work as well.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,400
Yeah.

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Mmm.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Okay.

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,720
Mmm.

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
Mmm.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,840
The last time we met,
you said that you love cats, right?

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,360
And you also said...

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
- Ah, thank you.
- It's all right.

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Thank you.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
And, so what other hobbies do you have?

36
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,440
I've got birds I look after,

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,200
and I like to do a thing called cosplay
and go to conventions.

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
- Comic conventions?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,600
I do too!

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
- Really?
- Yep.

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,640
Yeah, have you been to one before?

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,080
Yes, the Oz Comic-Con.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,760
I've been at that one.
Have you been to any others?

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,080
No, just that.

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah?

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
So, what else?

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,960
Hmm.

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Might have to come back to that one...

49
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Uh...

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,480
I wanted to ask you,
when is your birthday again?

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,640
I had it on Wednesday.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,640
- Oh, I missed it.
- Yeah.

53
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
When's yours?

54
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Twentieth of March.

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,720
Same month as my cat's.

56
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Yeah.

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,880
So, how many birds do you have?

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,720
About 12...

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
I think.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,960
- I used to have more.
- Oh.

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,560
So they flew away?

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,120
- Yep.
- Hmm.

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,600
That must have been saddening.

64
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,000
It's all right.

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,040
You just learn from it.

66
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,160
I suppose.

67
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Would you like to take a break?

68
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,360
I'll be back, okay?

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,560
- Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.
- Oops.

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Yeah.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,200
Is there anything we can do,
Amanda, to help you feel better?

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,880
I think it's too formal.

73
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,880
I can't do this.

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,560
It's just bad anxiety.

75
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,280
Um, Cian?

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,560
- Cian?
- Hmm?

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,960
- Did I go too far?
- Too far?

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,920
With... with the questions.

79
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,760
- No, I don't think so. Not at all.
- Oh.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
'Cause...

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
she seems a little bit quiet.

82
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Hmm.

83
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,400
- Um, here are your bag and your rose.
- Thank you.

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,440
This doesn't have to be a date.

85
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,280
- Yeah.
- We can just, um...

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,560
have a friendly dinner as friends?

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
I think...

88
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,160
wait, and I'll do another time.

89
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Yeah.

90
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
Shall I s...

91
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,680
see you to the... door?

92
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,560
If you want to.

93
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
Okay.

94
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,240
Well, it was lovely seeing you again,
Amanda.

95
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Mm-hmm.

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
Sorry how things turned out.

97
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
It's okay.

98
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,360
I do feel bad.

99
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
Don't feel bad.

100
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,240
I just feel like I may have gone
too far with the questions.

101
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,640
Well, you take care of yourself, Amanda.

102
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,400
- You too.
- And good luck.

103
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Yeah.

104
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,400
Oh, well.

105
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,440
That's... That's life, I guess.

106
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Hi, I'm Maddi.

107
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,320
I'm single, and I'm on the spectrum.

108
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,800
I enjoy video games, books, and animals.

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,200
How would you describe yourself,
Maddi?

110
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,360
I'm a very independent person.

111
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,080
Reasonably smart.

112
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,520
Uh, quirky.

113
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,480
Always seem to, like, stand out
a little bit without even trying.

114
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,680
Or I'm funny without trying,
people tell me, so...

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,440
What's something
you'd like people to know about you?

116
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,200
That just because I'm on the spectrum,
I'm not... I'm not...

117
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,160
I'm not dumb.

118
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,120
Some people can be
really condescending, like,

119
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,840
"How... are... you?" sort of thing.

120
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm like, please, come on.

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,960
How do you know
when you're in love?

122
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,480
Um, I can't really say for sure,
'cause I've never really been in love,

123
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,680
but I can only go by what...

124
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,760
like, what I've seen in movies and things,
so I'm not really...

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Can't get into that too well, sorry.

126
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,400
Can you describe
your ideal partner?

127
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,720
Tall, muscular...

128
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,600
rich.

129
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
So, what do you guys think
about me dating?

130
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,760
I think it's great if you wanna date.

131
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,240
Maybe you should date, get married,
and move out of home.

132
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,680
- Move out of home being the important one.
- Ah...

133
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,600
Well, how would you react
if I brought a boy home?

134
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,960
I think we'd cheer.

135
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,360
I'd have to vet him.

136
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,040
Make sure he was suitable for you.

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,000
Make him very uncomfortable.

138
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,520
Like we did with Montana,

139
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,416
- when she brought her boyfriend home.
- Right.

140
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
What do you think?

141
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,776
If I ever date, it'll be a couple of years
before he meets you guys, at least.

142
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,640
- Years?!
- That's a bit rude.

143
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
Protect the poor guy for a little while,
for God's sake.

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,400
- Oh!
- Okay, well what about tonight?

145
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,056
- Let's talk about tonight.
- Who's going?

146
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,000
So, superheroes disco tonight,
down at Darling Harbour.

147
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,760
- And what are you going as tonight?
- Look for a Superman girl.

148
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,120
- Batgirl?
- Yes.

149
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,240
Maybe we look for a Batman tonight.

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,160
Okay, we're focusing a bit too much
on tonight.

151
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,160
Well, I think you gotta start somewhere,
and maybe we start with tonight.

152
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,160
What do you think are the qualities
of a man that you'd like to date?

153
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,720
Rich, muscular, tall.

154
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,680
Eight-pack.

155
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,960
Like your mother landed.

156
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,440
Rich, muscular, tall. Mm-hmm.

157
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,320
You need to lower your standards.

158
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,200
You're not gonna get tall,
muscular, eight-pack.

159
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,656
- You don't go to the gym.
- Where'd this eight-pack come from?

160
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,520
It looks good.

161
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,736
- You don't go to the gym!
- I don't want someone flabby.

162
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
Excuse you! You don't either.

163
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,736
- We were supposed to go to the gym today.
- I did go.

164
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,960
There's no shame in being picky
when it comes to love.

165
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,560
What?

166
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,856
- Have I got this on backwards?
- Yep.

167
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,280
These ones go down over your shoe.

168
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,216
- So, at the back, like...
- No, at the front, so turn it round.

169
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,760
<i>Maddi's mum Terri</i>
<i>is her greatest support.</i>

170
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,240
There should be an elastic thing...

171
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,520
<i>She has taught Maddi</i>
<i>the communication skills</i>

172
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,440
<i>that have helped her step out
and socialize with her peers.</i>

173
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,680
Okay, pull it up.

174
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Yep.

175
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,080
I would like to see her
have somebody in her life.

176
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,760
Clearly, I'm not gonna be here forever.

177
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,320
It would give me some comfort

178
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,240
to think that someone's there
to look after her

179
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
and she's there
to look after somebody else.

180
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,120
There we go. Wow, that looks cool.

181
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,880
Where's the mask?
Did you put it somewhere?

182
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,280
- No, I've got the mask here.
- Thank you.

183
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,560
Do you ever worry
that she will end up alone?

184
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Yeah, all the time.

185
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
Mmm. All the time.

186
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
That's good.

187
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,080
Hello there.

188
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,600
Ready to party.

189

<i>Dance For Abilities</i>

Who do you know over here?

194
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,760
This man here,
you should be dancing with him.

195
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,080
And he's tall...

196
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,280
And a lot of money, he's Iron Man.

197
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,200
If he's ugly,
tell him to leave his helmet on.

198
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,456
All right, I get... I get the point.
I'll go talk to him.

199
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,880
All right, guys. Whoa, hello.

200
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,360
Would you like to dance?

Yes.

Tell me about yourself.
What are some of your hobbies?

212
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,920
Um...

213
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
I'm trying to think.

214
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Hmm.

215
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,080
Well, why... why don't I go first?

216
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,480
- My hobbies include video games...
- Yes.

217
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,600
- ...books, and animals.
- Yes.

218
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,920
What about for you?
What are some of your hobbies?

219
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,520
Um, I'm trying to think.

220
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,520
Do you like animals?

221
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,440
Yes.

222
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,400
Do you have any pets at home
that live with you?

223
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,800
- Yes.
- Cat or a dog?

224
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,520
I... I have a cat.

225
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,280
- Aww.
- I have a female cat named Marmalade.

226
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,200
- Is she a nice cat?
- Yes.

227
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,560
- Likes to play?
- Yes.

228
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Um...

229
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
Should we head back inside, you think?

230
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,600
- Yes.
- Or would you like to stay out? Okay.

231
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,880
Conga line! Conga line!

232
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,160
Conga! Everybody in the conga line!

233
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
Whoo!

234
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
So, Kelvin...

235
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,320
you just checking your hair?

236
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,040
- Looking good?
<i>- </i>Good. Good.

237
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Excellent.

238
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,080
So, you're ready to start?

239
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm Kelvin. I'm 21.

240
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
I have autism,

241
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,080
a disability which helps me
concentrate on one thing,

242
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,680
rather than getting distracted by others.

243
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,240
So, you think your autism
helps you to really focus on one thing.

244
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,640
How old were you when you were diagnosed
with autism, Kelvin?

245
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,800
Two years old.

246
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
Wow, that's pretty young, hey.

247
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,040
Do you think you're different
to other people your age?

248
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Yes.

249
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,960
How are you different?

250
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,080
I have a different, uh, look in my face,

251
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,720
and different personality from others.

252
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,640
How would you describe yourself?

253
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm caring, smart,

254
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,760
gentle, considerate,

255
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
and professional.

256
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,360
<i>Kelvin lives</i>
<i>with his single dad, David.</i>

257
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,000
We'll share it, Dad.

258
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,960
Yeah, maybe we can share. Yeah.

259
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,880
This is so delicious.

260
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,760
Mmm-mmm.

261
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
Would you like to see Kelvin
find a partner?

262
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,200
Yes, definitely, yes.

263
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,320
Being his father, yeah.

264
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,120
Yeah, I'd really like to see
if he can...

265
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
uh, have... have a date,

266
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,640
and then girlfriend, have a partner,

267
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,240
and then, even better, to have a family.

268
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,360
That's nice, isn't it?

269
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,680
A bit hard, but, uh, hopefully, uh,

270
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,360
there will be a day
that, uh, this is possible.

271
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,600
What's the hard part?
What do you think will be difficult?

272
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,760
I think it's the, like...

273
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,920
uh, for him to communicate with somebody
which is at the same wavelength.

274
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,840
How did you feel when you heard

275
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,520
- that he was on the spectrum?
- Uh, devastating,

276
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,880
but, uh, well, we have to come to terms,

277
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,760
and we have to try our best,
like, to help him.

278
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, that's what we did,
like, all these years.

279
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
Are you proud of him?

280
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Oh, definitely.

281
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,680
I'm very proud of my son, yeah.

282
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,320
Hopefully, one day, he will...
He will find his partner.Yeah.

283
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,920
Good to at least start
with maybe a bit of practice.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,680
- Hmm, yeah.
- Practicing what?

285
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,720
- Dad?
- Hmm?

286
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Practicing what?

287
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,280
Uh, go out dating
and seeing other, uh, people,

288
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,040
and seeing ladies...

289
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,200
Taking them out for dating, on dates?

290
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,560
Yep, have dinner, go to the movies, yeah.

291
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,000
Someone who is younger than you, Dad.

292
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,680
Yes, of course, yes.

293
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,560
For your dating, yes.

294
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
What do you think love feels like?

295
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,840
Love feels like when a man
and woman get together,

296
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,320
they'll make a perfect bond.

297
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,320
Do you think it's harder
for people with autism to find...

298
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,160
a relationship, to find a partner?

299
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,360
Some of them.

300
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,080
Some girls don't feel like dating
with someone in disa... with disabilities.

301
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,600
What?

302
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,920
What is it, Dad?

303
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,800
It's me, Cian.

304
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Can we come in?

305
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Um, yes.

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,080
This is a cute R2-D2 toy.

307
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
Say hi, R2-D2.

308
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,160
Beep-boop, beep-boop, beep-boop.

309
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,560
And this is the poster
of my year 12 formal.

310
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,080
Did you take a date to the formal?

311
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
I didn't.

312
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,200
I want to show you the drawings
that I made.

313
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,520
This is Chibi Tsuyu.

314
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,280
Eating frog cake.

315
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,440
This is Suzuha Amane.

316
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,800
She's strong-willed,

317
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
athletic,

318
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,000
like the one
that I'm looking forward to dating.

319
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,800
This is my original character,

320
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
Yuko Ezo.

321
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,720
She likes jellybeans, miso soup,
mackerel,

322
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,720
and carbonated drinks.

323
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,000
- So you made up that character?
- Yes. It's for my story.

324
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,600
- Where is your story?
- It's...

325
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,160
Wow, that is incredible.

326
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,760
You wrote all this?

327
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,080
Yeah, I wrote it from my mind.

328
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,480
I'll still keep on writing
until I reach the end of this book.

329
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,120
- I think that'll take you a while.
- What...?

330
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,560
Oh.

331
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,960
T-That's enough. Excuse me.

332
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,440
- That's enough for now, okay?
- Enough filming?

333
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,280
- Yes. Thank you.
- We'll see you next time.

334
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,520
Bye!

335
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,600
<i>After Michael's date</i>
<i>didn't end well,</i>

336
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,200
<i>he wants to talk through the experience</i>

337
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,920
<i>with relationship specialist Jodi Rogers.</i>

338
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,760
<i>- Hi, Michael!</i>
- Hello, Jodi.

339
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
How are things?

340
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,680
<i>- Very well, how are things with you?</i>
- Things have been pretty good.

341
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Just work and that's about it.

342
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,240
<i>Last time I was down there,</i>

343
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,640
<i>you were about to go out on a date
with somebody.</i>

344
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,840
About the date, it ended too early.

345
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,760
<i>Oh!</i>

346
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,720
My date got overwhelmed by the atmosphere.

347
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,080
She had anxiety,

348
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,920
and I was starting to get a bad vibe
about things.

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,040
I just told her that if she had to go,

350
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,040
she was quite welcome to.

351
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,080
That's really supportive.

352
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,680
<i>Till she had to leave,</i>

353
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,120
<i>did you feel like
you were getting to know her?</i>

354
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,360
Yeah, I was.

355
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,480
<i>Yeah? What things</i>
<i>did you have in common?</i>

356
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,680
We both love cats.

357
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,720
She loves comic conventions,
and I do as well.

358
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,680
<i>Would you like to see her again?</i>

359
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm actually gonna be seeing her
on Sunday.

360
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,440
<i>Well that's pretty good.</i>

361
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,680
We'll be going
to a comic convention together.

362
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,000
<i>Well that's excellent.</i>

363
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,640
<i>Do you think that the two of you</i>

364
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,080
<i>might find more things in common
with each other?</i>

365
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,960
Who knows? We might.

366
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,920
<i>It's very hard when the first time
you feel a little bit awkward</i>

367
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,520
<i>- and things don't go well.</i>
- Yeah.

368
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,360
<i>But this could be fantastic
on the weekend.</i>

369
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,200
<i>So, are you gonna wear a costume?</i>

370
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,960
Yes, the Skipper off <i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

371
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,640
<i>- That's a great costume!</i>
- Because... Because Dawn Wells,

372
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,400
who played Mary Ann on the show,

373
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,880
will be there herself.

374
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,600
<i>Oh, that's pretty exciting.</i>

375
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,400
She's pretty much the total package.

376
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,576
She's not the hottest woman in the world,

377
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,480
she's beautiful,
but not extremely beautiful,

378
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,280
but she's definitely polite,

379
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,040
she's pure and very wholesome.

380
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,600
That kind of woman is very hard to find.

381
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,240
- Which is unfortunate.
<i>- Okay.</i>

382
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,320
<i>So, if you had a girlfriend,</i>
<i>you'd want her to be more like Mary Ann.</i>

383
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Yes.

384
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,560
<i>- I think that sounds like a good plan.</i>
- Yeah.

385
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,520
<i>All right, well, just have fun.</i>

386
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,440
<i>- Just have lots and lots of fun on Sunday.</i>
- Yep. Will do.

387
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,800
- <i>It was lovely to speak to you.</i>
- Likewise. Thank you for your time.

388
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
<i>- See ya.</i>
- All right, see ya. Take care of yourself.

389
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,160
Would you say that you're different
to other people?

390
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,040
Well, yeah, 'cause I've got a disability,
I'm on the spectrum,

391
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,376
people are always gonna look at me
as different from them,

392
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,681
and I know I'm different from them,
and that's fine, so...

393
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,240
If we're all the same,
the world would be pretty boring.

394
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,560
Would you like to go out with a guy
who is also on the spectrum?

395
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Yes.

396
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,760
Some people like to choose

397
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,960
partners who are the exact opposites
of them.

398
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,216
They've run out of things to talk about.
How is that so?

399
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,160
If you have lots in common,
you wouldn't run out,

400
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,560
it'd be endless conversations.

401
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
So, I think...

402
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,800
similar personality traits is quite good.

403
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,440
<i>It's Valentine's Day.</i>

404
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,800
<i>And Maddi is getting ready
for her very first date.</i>

405
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,680
Wow, you look great!

406
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,000
Thank you, I know.

407
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,960
You've got
your special necklace on.

408
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,320
Yes, it's a favorite.

409
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,960
Your watch is even color-coded
with your top, tonight.

410
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
It's called "successorizing."

411
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,280
Successoring?

412
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,960
Success with accessories.

413
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,680
- Oh, I see.
- Oh, wow.

414
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,600
Old people are so out of the loop, really.

415
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,880
Excuse me!

416
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
So, how are you feeling about tonight?

417
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,760
Nervous.

418
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,160
Your very first date.

419
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,120
Yes.

420
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,560
On Valentine's Day.

421
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,720
I need a drink.

422
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,200
You need a drink...
You don't even drink!

423
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,120
I don't care.

424
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,840
- Can I take a photo?
- No. No.

425
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,160
- Can I take a photo?
- No!

426
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,160
Please, let me take a photo of you.
No, come on.

427
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,136
- I don't need to be fussed...
- I'm not gonna fuss. Just one quick photo.

428
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,120
- Please.
- Do not put it on Facebook.

429
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,160
No, I won't put it on Facebook.

430
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,120
One... two...

431
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,680
three.

432
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Okay.

433
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,400
First date photo.

434
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,520
Ooh! So excited!

435
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,320
- So excited!
- Please! Oh, God! No!

436
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,920
- God.
- Have a good night.

437
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,976
- I'm nervous.
- This is why I don't want you there.

438
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Okay. All right, all right.

439
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,456
- Leaving now.
- Have fun!

440
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,000
That's important. Have fun.

441
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,200
- Bye!
- See ya.

442
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,760
- Right, that's it, huh?
- She's off. She's launched.

443
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Oh, my goodness.

444
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,280
- I wonder if all the coaching...
- I'm gonna be so nervous for her.

445
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,280
<i>Maddi is meeting Mark.</i>

446
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,960
<i>Mark likes</i>

447
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,160
<i>dinosaurs,</i>

448
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,080
<i>moonlit nights,</i>

449
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,080
<i>and the sizzle of Mongolian lamb.</i>

450
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,960
<i>He doesn't like littering...</i>

451
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,920
<i>or rude words.</i>

452
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
- Hello.
- Hi.

453
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,560
- Are you Maddi?
- Yes.

454
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,920
- I'm Mark. Nice to meet you.
- Mark, nice to meet you.

455
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Thank you.

456
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,360
I got these for you.

457
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,360
Wow!

458
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,080
Thank you. Great. And this...

459
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,480
Thank you very much. They're lovely!

460
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,000
- Thank you very much.
- Right. Oh. It's nice to meet you.

461
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Lovely.

462
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,880
Yeah. Okay.

463
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,400
So, how's your day been so far?

464
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,840
Oh, yeah, pretty good.
Pretty good.

465
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,840
Much better now that there's sweets.

466
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,200
- Oh, yes.
- I love sweets.

467
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Ah.

468
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
How are you feeling?

469
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Uh...

470
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,120
Not too bad, actually.

471
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,520
Pretty... Pretty good.

472
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,680
Slightly nervous. But what about you,
how are you feeling?

473
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
I feel good.

474
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,896
- Really confident and excited.
- That's good.

475
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,640
Sorry to interrupt.
Would you like to order food?

476
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,560
For the main meal, I'll have the ravioli
with ricotta and spinach.

477
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,840
That would be nice.

478
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,640
And I will take...

479
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,880
the gnocchi, please.

480
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,160
The gnocchi?

481
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
- Thank you.
- Okay.

482
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,440
Thanks for that.

483
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,760
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your night.

484
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,120
- Thank you.
- We will, thank you.

485
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Okay.

486
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,800
What is your favorite thing in the world?

487
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Dinosaurs.

488
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,680
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm into paleontology, stuff like that.

489
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,000
- Into what, sorry?
- Paleontology.

490
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,280
How do you pronounce that? Pal...

491
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Paleontology.

492
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,360
Paleontology.
Sorry, I haven't heard of that one.

493
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,280
- That's okay.
- Paleontology.

494
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,760
- And that is?
- The study of prehistoric life.

495
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,720
Oh!

496
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,320
- Yes.
- Cool, that's pretty cool.

497
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,120
- But I'm...
- Palen... Sorry.

498
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,040
Palen... What is it?

499
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,360
- Pa-leon-to-lo-gy.
- Pa-leon...

500
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's all right, it's okay.

501
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
Paleontology, okay.

502
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah.

503
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,360
How's yours?

504
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,080
It was nice, it was really nice.

505
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,000
- I love ravi... ravioli.
- Mmm.

506
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,680
You look beautiful.

507
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,760
Very, very beautiful.

508
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,800
Thank you, you look...
you look quite nice your... yourself.

509
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,960
Thank you.

510
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,080
And that's a really beautiful necklace.
You're very lucky to have that.

511
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,280
It suits you well.

512
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,800
Thank you. Thank you.

513
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,640
I just wish this night didn't have to end.

514
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,120
I can't remember
when I've had this much fun.

515
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,480
Yeah! It's been... certainly been...

516
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,760
certainly been
a very interesting evening, so...

517
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Well...

518
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Thank you.

519
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,520
Thank you. Um...

520
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Maybe we should dine and dash,
what do you reckon?

521
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,920
Oh, no!

522
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
No? You don't... don't like that idea?

523
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,200
Subtotal...

524
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,160
We could grab our stuff
and run down the street.

525
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,720
What... What... What did you order?

526
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,160
The gnocchi.

527
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,920
Shall we pay for ours separately
or something?

528
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Uh...

529
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,280
I've... I've got money, so, like...

530
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,600
Would you like to split?

531
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
How would you like it?

532
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,080
Actually, um, I'll pay on this.

533
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Yeah.

534
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,600
Rest on the card?

535
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,040
Yes. Okay.

536
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,600
Well, it's nice to meet you.

537
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,520
It was nice to meet you, Mark.
Thank you for...

538
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,640
I hope we meet each other again.
I had a great time,

539
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,040
and I hope we can do this again.

540
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,360
I had a good time too.
It would be good to hang out...

541
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,640
- Yes.
- ...again, like...

542
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,000
And I wish you all the best.

543
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,376
- Thank you.
- Thanks, once again.

544
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,280
Thank you.

545
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,400
- See you. Have a wonderful night.
- Bye, Mark. Thank you very much for...

546
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
You're welcome.

547
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,600
- ...the flowers.
- Thanks.

548
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,640
- You have a good night.
- You too.

549
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,480
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

550
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
See ya.

551
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,400
How did the date go, Mark?
Do you like Maddi?

552
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,680
Oh, she's really nice and very sweet,

553
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
and charming.

554
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,240
I feel like she's the type of person

555
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,520
that I'd love to spe...

556
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,520
have spend my life with.

557
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,760
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mum.

558
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
How'd you go?

559
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,376
- Great.
- Did you have a lovely time?

560
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Oh, loved it.

561
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
- Lovely meal, and enjoyed the company?
- Oh, yes.

562
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,920
- Oh, she was spectacular.
- Beautiful?

563
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
Oh, that's lovely, darling.

564
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
She was a lovely woman.

565
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,640
Yeah? That's awesome.

566
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,160
Never had that much fun in one night.

567
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,160
Can't remember the last time
I ever felt this good.

568
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
Oh, really? I'm so happy for you.

569
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,520
So, how was tonight, Maddi?

570
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,760
Yeah, it was a good night.
I had fun. We had lots to talk about.

571
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,160
- He seems pretty smart, so, yeah.
- Yeah?

572
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,400
Yeah, not many people interested in...

573
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,176
paleontology. I think I've got that right.
Hope that was right.

574
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,360
Add the eight-pack,
and that'll be perfection, so...

575
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,440
Do you think
you're a romantic person?

576
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,640
I will be.

577
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
How would you ask a girl on a date?

578
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,000
If you liked someone,
how would you ask them?

579
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,200
Shall we go out for dinner together?

580
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,240
Or should we have some...

581
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,120
Shall we go out for a party...

582
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,320
and dance to the music together?

583
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
It'll be fun.

584
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,960
<i>As well as helping Michael,</i>

585
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,360
<i>relationship specialist Jodi Rodgers
has come to meet Kelvin</i>

586
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
<i>to work on his dating skills.</i>

587
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,440
Often when I meet people
for the first time,

588
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm really checking to see
what their ability is

589
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,240
with initiating conversation.

590
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,160
Sometimes I won't say hello to start with.

591
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,360
I'll wait and see whether they can
actually initiate verbally.

592
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,520
Because sometimes
people can't start a social interaction.

593
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,760
Cool, it's you. Jodi?

594
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,960
- Hello.
- Hey there.

595
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,000
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

596
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,680
Nice to meet you.

597
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,520
- My name's Kelvin.
- Nice to meet you, Kelvin.

598
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,280
It's called the autism spectrum,

599
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,760
because it's a spectrum.

600
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,440
Come on, follow me.

601
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,240
There is not two people
on the spectrum

602
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,840
where their autism presents
in the same way.

603
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,080
It is <i>so </i>diverse.

604
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,440
And that's its beauty.

605
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,000
It doesn't matter
whether you're on the spectrum or not,

606
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,320
everybody has a basic human right

607
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,320
and a basic human need
for connection and love.

608
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
So...

609
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,000
here's the girl.

610
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,160
Why do you want to have this girlfriend?

611
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,800
Because we... Because she's nice.

612
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,240
What will you and the girlfriend
do together?

613
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,120
Together... we should go out on... a date.

614
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,040
Yeah?

615
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,400
What else do girlfriends
and boyfriends do?

616
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,440
Hug and kisses?

617
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,280
Hugs and... yeah.

618
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,920
Hugs and kisses.

619
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,360
So, would you like to do hugs and kisses?

620
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,280
Yes.

621
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Yes.

622
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,160
When we go on our first date
with somebody,

623
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,160
what do we do on date number one?

624
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,000
We should introduce her by name...

625
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,360
first.

626
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,960
What if the girl
wants to sit down at the table?

627
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,720
What would you...
would be a good thing for you to do?

628
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,120
- Good thing...
- Like this, so you and I,

629
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,880
I'm... I'm... I'm gonna come...
Pretend Dad's not there,

630
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,680
'cause we don't want Dad
on the date, do we?

631
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
What?

632
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,960
No way,
Dad's not coming on the date.

633
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,520
You show me what a gentleman
would do if... if...

634
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,640
Jodi's coming on... to meet you.

635
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,320
- Okay, you ready?
- Are you a gentleman?

636
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
Hi.

637
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,920
Here you go. Here's your seat.

638
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
First of all,
you have to introduce...

639
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,640
Hi, my name's Kelvin Wong.

640
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,160
Nice to meet you.

641
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,400
My... My interests are manga and drawing
and computer.

642
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,280
Okay, first of all,
you want Jodi to sit down,

643
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,840
so we're on the same level.

644
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,400
- Don't we?
- Yes.

645
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,040
Okay, so here's my chair here. Try again.

646
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,880
- Okay.
- Okay, you ready?

647
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Here I come...

648
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,480
Hi, Jodi, my name is Kelvin Wong.

649
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,680
Nice to meet you.

650
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,600
Hello, Kelvin. My name's Jodi.

651
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,360
- Then the chair. Let her sit down.
- Uh... Here's your chair.

652
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,760
No, go out and take the chair,
and then...

653
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
- Go out and take...
- No.

654
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,480
No, Kelvin. Stand up, get the chair out,
and let the lady sit down.

655
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,960
And then you say, here's your...

656
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,080
- Here's your chair, Jodi.
- Thank you very much.

657
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,680
No, now you have to...

658
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,960
That's a good...

659
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,360
When... When the girl...

660
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,080
She might already be sitting,
but remember,

661
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,360
before you move
onto talking about yourself,

662
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,160
we always do greetings first.

663
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,120
Greeting. Greeting.

664
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,760
Now, how... how are we going
to start talking with the girl about...

665
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,320
common interest?

666
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Common...

667
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,720
Common inter...

668
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,120
If you just start talking about...

669
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,320
"Hi, I'm really into computers,
and I really like games and my iPad."

670
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
- No!
- Okay.

671
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,400
So the girls really like it...

672
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,240
if people, boys,

673
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,920
the first thing they do is ask them...

674
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,920
- A question.
- Perfect.

675
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,560
Because then the girl thinks...

676
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,800
"Kelvin is really interested in me."

677
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,760
What would be a good first question
that you could ask her?

678
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,640
Ask her... What are your interests?

679
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,200
Oh, nice one.

680
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,160
- What are your interests...
- Perfect!

681
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,160
...by the way.

682
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,120
Perfect.

683
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,720
So what about if she comes back
and she says,

684
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,440
"I love animals
and everything about animals."

685
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,760
Ooh.

686
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,320
Cutie, indeed.

687
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,800
And they are so cute like toys.

688
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,520
They are like toys. What about...

689
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,160
And then the girl might ask you
a question...

690
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,680
Do you like animals?

691
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,600
I meant, I'm also interested in animals.

692
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,720
We should go to the koala park.

693
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,920
You're fine... Well, that was nice.

694
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,320
Why were you suggesting
that you go to the koala park?

695
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,640
It's because she likes animals.

696
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,280
I'm really proud. That is excellent.

697
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,880
If she likes something
that you don't like, is that okay?

698
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,200
So, say she says,

699
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,880
"Oh, my favorite anime is...

700
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,880
<i>Sailor Moon."</i>

701
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,240
Yeah, uh, I used to...

702
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,640
What if she goes, "I like..."

703
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,920
I used to watch it,

704
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,120
but not anymore.

705
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Not anymore.

706
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,040
So is that okay that she likes
different anime and manga than you?

707
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,960
Yes, like,

708
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,640
I get that <i>Ouran High School</i>
is bad taste, and I shouldn't watch it,

709
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,760
because of... 'cause it has mature themes.

710
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,480
Okay. So, we started talking about anime.

711
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,200
What did you do with your body?

712
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,280
Uh...

713
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,200
Looking away.

714
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,320
You're looking away.

715
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,560
And that's a no.

716
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Exactly.

717
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,800
We've gotta keep the conversation being...

718
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Fifty-fifty.

719
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,200
Fifty-fifty.

720
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,280
So, if you turn away and start talking
to yourself about your manga...

721
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,000
It's not a good thing.

722
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,680
It's not fifty-fifty, is it?

723
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,640
I have to go to the bathroom.

724
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
I'll be back.

725
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,080
It's good that you come in
and, like, show him all this.

726
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,720
Like, it's very, very useful for him.

727
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,240
Sometimes, like, man to man,

728
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,920
- it's difficult to get over to him.
- It's very hard.

729
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,120
Do you know, I think this is stuff that...

730
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,680
This is all the...
the really simple things...

731
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,920
- Mmm.
- Um,

732
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,560
that we forget are so important
about social skills.

733
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,240
- Mmm-hmm, yes.
- But when you get to 21,

734
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,840
almost 22,

735
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,760
and he's desiring to have a relationship,

736
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,640
it's very hard for a dad to do that.

737
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
- Yeah, yeah.
- Isn't it?

738
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,560
- I find it really hard for me to...
- Yeah.

739
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,760
My job just is teaching people

740
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,240
- who are ready for...
- Um...

741
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,920
- ...dating and relationships.
- Yeah.

742
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,680
- And...
- Uh, for next one,

743
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,840
I'll ask her what movie we're watching.

744
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,600
Oh, have you been thinking about that?

745
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh, I... I was thinking.

746
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,680
So, the most important thing
about the first date is...

747
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,320
Is the...

748
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,240
Is, um...

749
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,880
Greet her!

750
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
Greet her.

751
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,480
And what are you trying to find out?

752
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,200
You're trying to find out...

753
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,960
what you have in...

754
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,600
What?

755
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,160
- In common.
- Perfect.

756
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,600
You have to have some things
that are the same...

757
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,400
but you're allowed to have
some things that are...

758
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,000
- Different.
- Perfect.

759
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,200
I think your dating's gonna be good.

760
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,040
Just remember, we go up the steps...

761
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,800
slowly.

762
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,160
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy.

763
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,680
I think for Kelvin, the challenge
is just gonna be the beginning.

764
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,520
Challenges of social skills
with another person.

765
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
He's at the really beginning journey

766
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,320
of understanding what it is
to be with another person

767
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,840
and what that feels like,

768
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,280
and has to go through all the things
that we all go through.

769
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,440
The rejection,

770
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,480
finding out whether we've got
a good match with somebody...

771
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,880
At this stage in his learning,

772
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,200
it's... it's about practicing.

773
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,160
Just getting out there
and giving it a go,

774
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,720
and finding out
who's a good match for him.

775
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,320
Out you go, Jodi.

776
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,120
I'll see you anytime.

777
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,280
- Okay, see you, Kelvin!
- See you!

778
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,480
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

779
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,600
How'd it go?! How'd it go?!

780
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,080
Tell me all about it!

781
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,320
Calm down.

782
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,760
How did it go?

783
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,560
Yeah, fine. He was a very nice guy.

784
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,160
Really? What did he look like?

785
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,080
- Oh, you've got a photo?
- Yes, I do.

786
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
Perfect!

787
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,280
Oh, he's very nice.

788
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,840
Yeah. Yeah...

789
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,280
Are they the flowers that he brought you?

790
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,200
Yeah.

791
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,640
- That was a nice touch, white roses.
- Yes, yes.

792
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,280
What did you do when you got the roses?

793
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,960
- I said thank you and hugged him.
- You hugged him?!

794
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
- Yeah, like...
- Show me. Show me what you did.

795
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,320
Just like that, sort of thing.

796
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,240
- Oh!
- I can do it properly standing up.

797
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760
Oh, that's a good thing.

798
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,480
Don't make a fuss, honestly.

799
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,280
No, everything was okay?
All right, tell me all about him.

800
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,560
What do you mean?

801
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,240
Well, do you want to see him again?

802
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,160
- Yes.
- Perfect.

803
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,000
I think he looks
like he's good son-in-law material.

804
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,400
Off you go, thanks. Off you go. Goodbye.

805
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,040
Okay, all right.

806
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,120
Parents, honestly...

807
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,480
Jeez, Louise.

808
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,376
Do you feel like you've got
a lot of love to give?

809
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,240
Yes.

810
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
All the people I know and care about,

811
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,280
they know me for my...

812
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,000
for my large heart,

813
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,040
which was once described as...

814
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,480
ten sizes too large.

815
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,440
Aha! There she is.

816
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,400
- Hello, Amanda.
- Hey!

817
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,560
Good to see you again.

818
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,760
Good to see you.

819
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,240
What are you dressed up as?

820
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,040
My character name's Riko.

821
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
From what?

822
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,640
An anime called <i>Love Live!</i>

823
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,800
- Ah.
- Yeah.

824
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
- Right.
- What's the book you've got?

825
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,080
Oh, that's a cookbook.

826
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,680
- Is that part of your character?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

827
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,840
- Oh.
- Actually, um...

828
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,240
I wanted to see if I could get Dawn Wells
to, um, autograph this.

829
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,720
Okay.

830
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,360
Is there anywhere you wanna go?

831
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,080
Uh, yes. Um, you want to check out
a few places?

832
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Okay.

833
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,000
Do you know much about Dawn Wells?

834
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
No...

835
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,960
- Barbara Eden?
- No.

836
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,640
- Barbara Feldon?
- No.

837
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Oh.

838
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,920
Then you probably haven't seen
<i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

839
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,360
- No.
- Or <i>Get Smart.</i>

840
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,280
- No...
<i>- </i>Or <i>I Dream Of Jeannie?</i>

841
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,560
- Mmm-mmm.
- Ah.

842
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,960
Oh, look, there's one
with a costume right now!

843
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,976
- The genie? Yeah!
- Look! Look!

844
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,360
- I can see.
- That's her!

845
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,040
- Yep.
- That's the costume.

846
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,400
If you ever wanted to have lunch
or dinner somewhere,

847
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,000
we don't have to...
have to go somewhere formal.

848
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,640
- Okay.
- We can go somewhere casual.

849
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,560
Yeah.

850
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,760
Probably should've done that
the first time.

851
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,600
So, what do you wanna look at first?

852
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,880
There is something I want to get.

853
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,320
It's up this way.

854
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Oh, no.

856
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,400
Everything okay?

857
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,240
- Don't you agree that that mask is creepy?
- Where?

858
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,040
Right there, the guy with the dark hair.

859
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,040
I refuse to watch those <i>Halloween </i>films.

860
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,680
- You don't like them?
- I hate 'em.

861
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,120
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

862
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,480
- Yeah.
- They're too scary.

863
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,360
A little bird tells me
that you love plushes.

864
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,040
I do. I've got lots of them.

865
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,440
- Yeah?
- Yep.

866
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,720
I actually have a bit of an affinity
for them myself.

867
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,120
You like them too?

868
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,640
I keep it secret, though.

869
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,960
Oh.

870
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,560
It's because they're...
They're not exactly something for men.

871
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,280
How are you feeling, by the way?

872
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
I'm okay.

873
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,720
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

874
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,720
Not feeling anxious in any way?

875
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,400
I want you to feel comfortable.
That's all I care about right now.

876
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
You recognize something?

877
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,360
Does look like you.

878
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,160
- Should we buy this one?
- Yes.

879
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,600
Okay, then I'll get it for you.

880
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,280
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

881
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,360
I'll just grab that, thank you.

882
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,760
Thank you.

883
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,640
- There you are, Amanda.
- Thank you.

884
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
It's my pleasure.

885
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,200
It's a little gift from me to you.

886
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,040
Well, I...
I'll be heading off to, um, my...

887
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,920
that autograph and photograph thing.

888
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,200
- Yep.
- So, right now, um...

889
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,200
I have to say, it was really lovely
spending time with you again.

890
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,640
It was good to see you too.

891
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,560
Thanks.

892
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,240
Are you interested in, um, spending time
together again sometime soon?

893
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,560
I'll think about it.

894
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,160
Okay, you just have the time
to think it over.

895
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,400
- And, um, take care.
- See you later.

896
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
And good luck.

897
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,000
She's still a great person
to spend time with.

898
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,840
We're... We're friends, probably.

899
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,200
Dating? Probably not.

900
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,480
<i>Michael's day</i>
<i>isn't over just yet.</i>

901
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,040
<i>He's about to meet his perfect woman.</i>

902
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,360
There she is, right over there.
Right over there.

903
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Oh, dear.

904
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,760
I can't believe this is happening!

905
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,600
- You okay?
- Yep.

906
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,800
I can't remember the last time
I felt this excited.

907
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Oh, dear.

908
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,200
It's finally happening!

909
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,200
There's the Skipper.
I've seen you all day.

910
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,120
Hey, hello.

911
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,280
Dawn Wells!

912
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,400
- George Smith. What's your name?
- Michael Theo.

913
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,896
- Hello, Michael.
- It is... It is...

914
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,160
I can't tell you what an honor this is.

915
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,000
Since you were a little boy.

916
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,920
- Yep.
- Yeah.

917
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,800
- Yep. Since...
- Where'd you grow up?

918
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,760
- Wollongong.
- Where's that?

919
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,640
- That's on the south coast.
- Yes.

920
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,016
- Yep.
- You'd make a good Skipper!

921
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,280
- Thanks!
- Can I hug you?

922
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,776
- Yeah, sure, absolutely!
- Where's our camera? Right over here.

923
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,560
Here's the Skipper!

924
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,440
- Have a good life, dear.
- You too, Dawn Wells.

925
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,960
- Thank you, dear.
- And also... God bless you.

926
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,920
God bless you too.

927
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

928
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,560
That's one of the most
cherished moments I've ever had in life.

929
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,240
It was quite a privilege.

930
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,160
Really loved it.

931
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
Do you have anything else
you want to say?

932
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Oh, yes.

933
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,400
One thing that I'd like to...

934
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,840
One message that I'd like to send
to all women in the world.

935
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,560
I would be the kind of partner
that is able to provide

936
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,720
five things that every woman needs.

937
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,560
Love, respect, happiness, support,
and security.

938
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,680
- Oops.
- Uh-oh. Here's trouble.

939
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,120
- Oh, my goodness, who's that?
- Who's that?

940
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
Hello?

941
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,280
<i>Hello, it's... This is Mark.</i>

942
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,840
- Hi, Mark, how are you? It's Maddi.
<i>- I'm...</i>

943
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,600
<i>How... I'm good. How are you, Maddi?</i>

944
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,960
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.

945
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,976
<i>Oh, that's.. that's great.</i>

946
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,760
- We've...
<i>- That's wonderful to hear.</i>

947
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,480
I've recently adopted a new puppy.

948
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,280
- <i>Awesome! That's great.</i>
- Yeah.

949
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,016
- He's a...
<i>- What kind...</i>

950
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,520
He's a miniature schnauzer
and his name is Arnold.

951
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
- <i>Arnold.</i>
- Yeah.

952
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,240
<i>Oh, lovely, lovely.</i>

953
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,496
<i>- That's wonderful to hear.</i>
- Ask him what he's been doing.

954
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,000
<i>Great, you've got a companion.</i>

955
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,600
Yes, a new best friend.

956
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,080
- Ask him...
<i>- Yeah.</i>

957
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,920
<i>Also, I've been ringing you up because</i>

958
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,840
<i>I was just thinking, would you like to go
on a second date to Sydney next Friday?</i>

959
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,456
- Next Friday.
- Yes, that would be...

960
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,640
Yes, I would like... I would like to do
another catch-up. That'd be interesting.

961
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,200
<i>Yes.</i>

962
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,576
- Where?
<i>- And I was thinking maybe I could</i>

963
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,480
<i>take you to the Australian Museum, and...</i>

964
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,520
<i>we can go for a walk through Hyde Park.</i>

965
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,296
Yeah, that sounds like...
That sounds like it'll be good.

966
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,120
<i>Yeah, or whatever, you know.</i>

967
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,080
- Yeah.
- You need to...

968
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,960
<i>Because I had such a great time</i>
<i>the last time.</i>

969
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,320
<i>It was really wonderful,</i>

970
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,440
<i>and I would love to do something
like that again.</i>

971
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,720
Yeah, it was... it was nice, wasn't it?
It was pleasant.

972
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,640
Will he remember? Ask him.

973
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
Oh, well, you'll...

974
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,440
You'll probably remember what I look like
after one date, I think?

975
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,400
<i>Of course I will.</i>

976
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
Great.

977
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,600
<i>Yes, I mean...</i>

978
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,600
<i>I can never forget a beautiful face.</i>

979
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,560
Thank you, that's very kind to say.

980
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,080
- Nice work.
<i>- It's okay. It's...</i>

981
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,640
<i>It's a pleasure.</i>

982
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,560
<i>That's okay.</i>

983
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,480
<i>Anyway, thanks for your time, Maddi.</i>

984
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,120
<i>And I look forward to seeing you again.</i>

985
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,760
No problem, I'll... I'll see you later.

986
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,600
- <i>Have a wonderful week.</i>
- You too.

987
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,520
<i>I'll see you next Friday.</i>

988
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
See you then.

989
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,880
- <i>Okay, goodbye.</i>
- Bye!

990
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Wow!

991
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,920
Okay.

992
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,680
Such a pretty face.

993
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,000
- So, can't forget a pretty face! Whoo-hoo!
- Mmm!

994
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,440
This is exactly why you guys
are not coming.

995
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,160
Maybe we should go and meet his parents.

996
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,080
No!

997
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,920
Make sure he comes
from the right background.

998
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,400
Right background. Sounds like it is.

999
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,320
What?

1000
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,280
No. You're rushing things. No.

1001
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,680
Oh. Okay.

1002
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,240
How would you feel about having
a partner and having love in your life?

1003
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,160
It would make me feel confident.

1004
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,440
I got pictures of girls in my brain,
right now.

1005
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,520
They look cute.

1006
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,920
And they make me feel like
I'm gonna love them.

1007
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,480
<i>It's Friday...</i>

1008
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,960
<i>and Kelvin is getting ready
for a special night.</i>

1009
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,480
<i>His first ever date.</i>

1010
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,960
Okay, you're all ready to go.

1011
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,080
- Okay.
- Thanks, Dad.

1012
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,720
Just enjoy yourself tonight, huh?

1013
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,000
Just remember what Jodi said
in the morning.

1014
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,880
- Do a greeting with her.
- Yeah.

1015
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,240
- And then introduce each other.
- Yeah.

1016
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,240
And then talk to each other
about interests.

1017
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,480
- That's right.
- Fifty-fifty.

1018
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,600
That's right.

1019
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,360
You don't need to say it.
Just in your mind. Just remember it, yeah?

1020
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
- Okay.
- Okay.

1021
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Yeah.

1022
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,080
Looks like
I'll be having fun tonight.

1023
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,104
