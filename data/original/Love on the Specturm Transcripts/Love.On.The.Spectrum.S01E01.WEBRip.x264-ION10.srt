00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,920
- What do you think love is?
- It'll be like a fairy tale.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,560
A natural high, I suppose?

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,160
Gets your heart racing.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,600
Can make people do crazy things.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,320
You just feel very warm inside yourself
as a person.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,360
- So, have you ever been in love?
- No.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,240
- Have you been in a relationship?
- No.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,080
- Have you been on a date?
- No.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,040
<i>Finding love</i>
<i>can be hard for anyone.</i>

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,560
That was too awkward.

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,200
<i>And for some people,</i>
<i>it can feel like an impossible dream.</i>

Some girls don't feel like dating

- Yes, ready.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Hello.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,040
My name is Michael,

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,920
and I happen to be a 25-year-old man.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,120
How do you feel
about being on the spectrum?

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
Well, autism is just
a neurological disability.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,440
People with Asperger's or autism,
they just learn things a different way.

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,240
As far as I'm concerned,

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,080
if anything, it's actually more of a gift.

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,880
And are you looking for love,
Michael?

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, yes, I am.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,040
I would like to start dating.

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,680
I just, um...

36
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,160
don't really know how to get started,
because...

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,440
I've tried numerous ways,
and they've all been unsuccessful.

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
What's your greatest dream in life?

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,400
To become a husband.

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,480
<i>People on the spectrum</i>
<i>often have trouble socializing,</i>

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,640
<i>and meeting potential partners
can be difficult.</i>

42
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,360
This room here is my bedroom,

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,480
but I actually call it my quarters.

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,880
It's the main place in this world
that I feel safe.

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,400
These are my love ducks.

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,120
If you are single and seeking love,

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,600
sit them beside your bed
and love is sure to come your way.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,480
I actually bought them from a store
in Newtown six years ago.

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,440
Excuse me a second, gentlemen.

50
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,776
- Oh, what is that?
- It's a plaque.

51
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,480
I actually made it specifically
for my future wife.

52
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,776
- When did you make this?
- Five years ago.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,560
Wow, you really want this, Michael!

54
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,800
Oh, yes, I do.

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,320
It's most important thing
that I want to achieve.

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,680
Well, I hope we can help you
achieve that.

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,200
I really hope so, too.

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,440
I seriously do.

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,480
<i>Later this week,</i>
<i>with help from the filmmakers,</i>

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,520
<i>Michael will have
his first dating experience</i>

61
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
<i>at a singles dinner.</i>

62
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,320
I often compare myself to Adam,
my brother, a lot,

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,720
which is a big mistake.

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,760
I would often label him
as a fresh cut of meat from God,

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,440
and myself as a double scoop of dog shit.

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,200
Why on earth he wanted to compare himself
to me, I don't know, but...

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,520
It's because I've often felt inferior
to my brother.

68
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,160
Adam was able to get himself
in a relationship easily,

69
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,400
whereas I had trouble doing so.

70
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,840
The challenges that you face, Mike,
I think a lot of other people face, too.

71
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,600
To struggle at some point or another
to find, like, proper love.

72
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
But for some strange reason,

73
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,840
I don't seem to recall Adam
having any problems like that.

74
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,720
Because we're all different.

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,920
But Michael, you've seen
over the past few years,

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,600
how it just hasn't worked out for me
either. Like, it just turns to shit.

77
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,320
That's also because a lot of people
our age aren't interested in commitment.

78
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,240
They're only interested in intercourse.

79
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
Yeah. Look, it's true.

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,560
Oops.

81
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,416
- Dad, did you drop your food?
- Yeah.

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,680
And also... I've also... What I've also
noticed with a lot of girls your age, Liv,

83
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,376
when they're still in high school,
they only want a boyfriend for...

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,640
- Intercourse.
- Not just... Not just for intercourse,

85
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,480
but also as a bodyguard

86
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,000
and as a sugar daddy.

87
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,560
I think every family needs a Michael.

88
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,320
It just adds something different.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
Hi, I'm Chloe. I'm 19, and I'm autistic.

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,680
I was born, well, not completely deaf,

91
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,640
but never been able to hear fully.

92
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,120
I have hearing aids,
it's nothing to be ashamed of.

93
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,280
Have you ever been in love?

94
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,240
N...

95
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,600
Not romantic love.

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,040
I don't know what it's like
to fall in love or have a crush.

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,240
- So, have you ever dated?
- Yes, I have.

98
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,800
I once dated a guy who, when I told him
that I was autistic, he left me,

99
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
because he didn't want to be associated
with someone who's autistic.

100
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,600
How did that make you feel?

101
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,760
Well, I was a bit... angry,

102
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
or I was confused.

103
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,120
I was like, is autism really bad?

104
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,056
- And you accept your autism?
- Yes, I do.

105
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,800
Took me a while, but I do, yes.

106
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,480
When I tell someone I'm autistic,

107
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,480
people go, "Really? No, you're not.
You don't look autistic."

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,280
And I can say, "What does
an autistic person look like?"

109
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,200
<i>Chloe was 11</i>
<i>when she was diagnosed with autism.</i>

110
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,920
<i>In the past, girls were four times
less likely than boys to be diagnosed.</i>

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,280
<i>But that number is steadily increasing
as we learn more</i>

112
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,920
<i>about the presentation of autism in girls.</i>

113
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,760
I want to experience love.

114
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,920
I want to be like everyone else, you know?

115
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,040
I just don't want to be alone
for the rest of my life.

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,720
I see so many people holding hands
and kissing and doing all that,

117
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
and that's something I want.

118
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,840
I had, like, all these ideas in my head,
and none of them happened.

119
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,240
Life is not a movie.

120
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,480
What's up, man? Come here.

121
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,776
When you start doing
the whole dating thing,

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,680
that fairy-tale thing,

123
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,360
- it's gonna take a while to get to that.
- Yeah, I know.

124
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
So, you know, don't expect that
as the first one,

125
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,160
because it's not an easy situation
to get into.

126
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
I'd like someone who I can talk to
about Marvel, or, you know...

127
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,120
- Exactly.
- ...new cartoons and animes coming out.

128
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
So, I'll go and crack on
and start doing some dinner stuff.

129
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,200
Remember, not touching.

130
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,160
It won't be touching, Chloe.
It won't be touching, I promise.

131
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,880
I'm very picky when it comes...

132
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,160
I don't like things touching other things.

133
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,920
The beans have to be separated.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,560
Like, a little bit of beans on the side,
they can't touch.

135
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,320
All right, let them start warming.

136
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,160
She's a really intelligent girl.

137
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
She's, you know, incredibly intelligent,

138
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,120
but socially, she's not.

139
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,240
She's often had a lot of problems

140
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,960
with difficulties reading
someone's emotions.

141
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
It's a lot harder to make a friendship.

142
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,600
So, to move onto anything intimate,

143
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
I think it would be a <i>huge</i> challenge.

144
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,000
From the little girl that couldn't say
any words to me,

145
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,800
to the day she said "daddy"
for the first time,

146
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,760
to where she is now, yeah,
I'm hugely proud of where she's come from.

147
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,440
She's... She's done fantastically.

148
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,360
She's, um... yeah.

149
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,080
After everything she's had against her.

150
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,520
- Yep, sorry.
- No, you're all right.

151
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, no, she's done really well.

152
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,400
I used to get bullied quite a lot
in school in England for how I look.

153
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,640
I got called names, I got pushed,

154
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,360
I had, you know, my work ripped up,

155
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,400
and called me deaf,
and then I got called "skeleton."

156
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,600
I think, you know, being bullied
has made me who I am,

157
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,560
and if I wasn't bullied, I would've been
someone completely different.

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,800
<i>Chloe's best friend Brodie</i>
<i>lives nearby.</i>

159
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,680
<i>They catch up socially
several times a week.</i>

160
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Do you want milkshake or tea?

161
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,120
- A tea.
- A tea?

162
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,280
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

163
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,520
What do you want?

164
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
I don't know. Same as you.

165
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

166
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,880
My friend Brodie
has Down's syndrome,

167
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,400
and she's mute and deaf,

168
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
but she signs, and I sign a lot,

169
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,280
and we're like this.

170
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
You know, can't separate us.

171
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,600
And we cause... We get told
we cause a lot of trouble, and...

172
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,360
You know, we just don't follow the rules.

173
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,280
Oh, look, Brodie, boy!

174
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,920
You like him?

175
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,280
You gonna talk to the boys?

176
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Come on.

177
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Come on.

178
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,400
Come on, talk to the boys.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,520
No, you! You!

180
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,200
Hey.

181
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,160
Want to talk?

182
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,520
Hello.

183
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Come here.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,640
I don't know their names.

185
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,120
Cheeky.

186
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,640
- You're cheeky.
- No, you're cheeky.

187
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,480
A lot of things happen
when me and Brodie go out.

188
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,960
I just think she's this amazing person,

189
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,720
and she's absolutely amazing to be around.

190
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,160
I just find it sad
that some people just look at her

191
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
for, you know, what she looks like,

192
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,760
and just, uh... you know, judges her.

193
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,720
Yeah, you're cheeky.

194
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,880
Hello.

195
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,000
Um, my name is Ruth Garlick,

196
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,400
and, uh, I'm 22 years old,

197
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
and, um...

198
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,920
I'm primarily a deaf autistic.

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,320
And who's this?

200
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,680
What's this?

201
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,920
Oh, this is my baby snake Cleopatra.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,960
She helps me to stay calm.

203
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,600
And it means I don't have
a lot of sensory overload

204
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,000
when I'm handling her.

205
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,240
Can you describe your ideal partner?

206
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,440
Oh, sure, um...

207
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,120
My ideal... ideal partner
would be a blondie

208
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,480
who's a big cuddler.

209
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,480
He also needs to be able
to be okay with my quirks

210
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,960
and my nerdiness.

211
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,560
He's just over there. Come along.

212
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,880
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hello.

213
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm Thomas.

214
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
We've been, um, dating for...

215
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
about four years now,

216
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,720
and I think we do all right together.

217
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,640
Thomas, what do you love about Ruth?

218
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,160
She's funny, fun to be with, um...

219
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,840
r-really smart...

220
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,320
a-a-a killer body,

221
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,840
and just puts up with me.

222
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,760
Yeah, he loves my body,
that's why he stays with me.

223
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,640
I... I really do. It's sexy.

224
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,040
Sexy.

225
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,280
I think we do work well together.

226
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm autistic enough to understand Ruth,

227
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,680
and she can understand me back.

228
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,640
Likening it to curry,

229
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,520
she's a very spicy chicken tikka masala,
but I'm... I'm a nice...

230
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,840
nice mild, um, butter chick...

231
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,120
No, I'm a... I'm a mango chicken.
I've decided I want to be a mango chicken.

232
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,960
Yeah, so basically, I'm fire,
and he's water.

233
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,560
And together, fire and water,
things get steamy.

234
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,040
That's true.

235
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,960
That's very naughty.

236
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Yes, it is.

237
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,560
<i>For Ruth and Thomas,</i>
<i>finding love has led to independence.</i>

238
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,600
<i>They moved in together
just over a year ago.</i>

239
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,840
This is my card collection.

240
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,160
This here's thick.

241
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,240
So it's quite heavy.

242
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,360
This is one of my favorite sections,
which is food.

243
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,200
- So you collect business cards?
- Yes, I do.

244
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,080
What's your guess
at how many you have?

245
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,600
How many? Um, probably thousands.

246
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Look, there's...

247
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,560
This is a lot.

248
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,080
I can't wait to sort them all out.

249
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,960
I don't think I've ever met anyone
who collects business cards.

250
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Well, autistic people are known
for being pretty unusual.

251
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,480
This is my garden railway.

252
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,840
A garden is your own idea of heaven.

253
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,320
So, of course, mine's gonna have
a train running through it.

254
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,360
When did you guys first meet?

255
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,680
My sister told me that, um,
she knew another aspie at church,

256
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,680
and, uh, she wanted me to meet him,

257
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,320
because she thought
we'd become friends.

258
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,360
We immediately understood each other.

259
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,160
We... And I actually...

260
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,760
When we first met each other,
I wrote in my journal,

261
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,000
"Oh, I want to marry this guy."

262
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,400
I didn't know that.

263
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,040
That's true. I told you that before.

264
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Likes her milk.

265
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
That's why I need to go buy some.

266
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,840
What's that picture on the fridge?

267
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,440
- That one?
- Hmm.

268
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,720
Ruth drew that for my birthday.

269
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,160
"Happy birthday, Tom,

270
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,880
from your crazy girlfriend Ruthy."

271
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,160
And then that is, um, runes.

272
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,240
Can't wait to marry you.

273
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,080
I love you, Ruth.

274
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,200
Apparently, it says that.

275
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,080
If I actually was dating somebody,

276
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,280
and I actually entered a relationship,
and then eventually...

277
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
married her,

278
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,000
I would treat her as my top priority.

279
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,120
She would be pretty much my most valuable
and greatest treasure of all time.

280
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,080
She'd practically be my million dollars.

281
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,640
- Mike, can you get me some salt?
- Yeah.

282
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,760
- You mean the sea salt?
- Yep. Please.

283
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,080
Why do you think Michael's
finding it hard to meet someone?

284
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,680
I think he just needs to find somebody
that's like-minded.

285
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,280
I don't think he wants anybody loud.

286
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
Or gothic.

287
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,000
- Mm-hmm.
- Or tomboyish.

288
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,920
Mm-hmm.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,320
Or practically any girl that acts like...
like she's still in high school.

290
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,680
Yeah. Sounds right.

291
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,920
If she's the right person for me, then...

292
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
I'll... I'll consider proposing to her.

293
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,360
- Okay.
- By coincidence, I've already decided

294
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,600
on the perfect wedding ring
for my partner.

295
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,000
In the form of a crown...

296
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,960
to signify that she'll be my queen,
per se.

297
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,360
But I'm not really too keen on kids
at the moment, because...

298
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,800
I have a feeling that having children
will ruin my chances of becoming wealthy.

299
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,600
They kinda do.

300
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,240
But what if you meet a girl
that wants to have children,

301
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,560
and you're like,
"Oh, but that's gonna take away

302
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,720
from my bank account."
What are you gonna do?

303
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,360
I'll simply tell her, "Okay,
I'll allow it, but on one condition.

304
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,040
I get a vasectomy after the second child."

305
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Okay.

306
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,480
I've been single for 25 years.

307
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,760
I'm not too willing to be single
for another 25.

308
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,240
What if you are?

309
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Mum.

310
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,440
I still refuse to take that for an answer.

311
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,480
But it's not an answer. I'm just saying,
it's a hypothetical what-if.

312
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,960
Not what if. It <i>will.</i>

313
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,360
Okay. That's it.

314
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,200
Not what if. It will.

315
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,760
It will. Okay.

316
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,800
It will.

317
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,960
<i>To help him</i>
<i>in his search for love,</i>

318
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,360
<i>Michael is meeting Jodi Rogers,</i>

319
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,920
<i>a relationship specialist
who works with people on the spectrum.</i>

320
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,280
When they're children,
there's a lot of support

321
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,840
given to people with autism

322
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,200
about social skill and social interaction.

323
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,440
And I think when people reach adulthood,

324
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,840
and they're really looking
for intimate relationships,

325
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,840
I think that we don't give
a lot of support to understanding

326
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,040
the really great complexity...

327
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,680
...of flirting with somebody else,

328
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,920
or how do we develop an intimate
relationship with somebody else?

329
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

330
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,760
You must be Jodi.

331
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,800
- Yes, hello. Are you Michael?
- Yes, I am.

332
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,240
Where do people meet each other
when they're on the autism spectrum?

333
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,640
People go onto sort of
a mainstream dating site,

334
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,920
and then do you out yourself
as being on the spectrum,

335
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
which is really complex?

336
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,520
I've never had a partner before.

337
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,960
I've always had some trouble
trying to find a partner.

338
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,000
Why do you think that is?

339
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,920
Well, a lot of girls
that I've been friends with in the past,

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,880
a... a lot of those friendships
have turned out to be quite...

341
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,840
disappointing.

342
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,600
Do you have trouble with understanding
another person's body language?

343
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,040
I have very little trouble.

344
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,280
Facial expressions
always give something away.

345
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,240
That's great.
It's excellent that you say that.

346
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,720
Because some people on the spectrum,
they really have difficulty with that.

347
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,720
So that's excellent

348
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,120
- that you've got that ability to do that.
- Yeah. Yes.

349
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,280
When I'm with somebody,
if they're trying to mask...

350
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,520
mask something...

351
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,160
- He knows.
- ...on their face,

352
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,680
I'll just simply say,

353
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,760
mask it all you want,
but I know what you're actually feeling.

354
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
- Yes!
- Really?

355
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,240
He... And you know what,
he's so good at it.

356
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,520
He's so... Even with people he's just met.

357
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,160
I've been studying human behavior
for many years.

358
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,640
That's excellent, Michael.

359
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,160
- Specifically in women.
- Yeah.

360
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,160
Oh.

361
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,640
It's because I've always taken
a bit of an interest in it,

362
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,120
in a... in a strange way.

363
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,520
No, that's not strange. Do you know what,
if you're on the autism spectrum,

364
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,080
and you find body language difficult,

365
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,280
actually studying body language

366
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,760
is a really important thing to do.

367
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,280
I was told that nonverbal cues,
he'll never be able to get.

368
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,960
Excuse me, nonverbal cues?

369
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,440
Look at his gift.

370
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,400
I was told, "Oh, you know,

371
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,200
you'll... you'll probably never
hear him say I love you."

372
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,800
They said he probably won't have
any empathy for others.

373
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,440
Biggest bunch of rubbish I ever heard.

374
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,840
It's just a difference
in the way that they do things.

375
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,280
They're just different, that's it.

376
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,560
And people with autism
have incredible affection...

377
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,280
- Yes.
- ...and deep love.

378
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,120
- Yes!
- Really wanting to connect.

379
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,896
When people talk to Michael,
they might find him a bit of an oddball,

380
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,280
a bit quirky, and stuff like that.

381
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,880
But the thing is, we've raised him
and taught him...

382
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,640
to be confident with himself,
and that, you know what?

383
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,256
Even as so-called "normal people,"
we don't have all the answers.

384
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,880
But you two have obviously done
a really, really fantastic job as parents.

385
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,480
They haven't given me everything.

386
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,520
Not everything, but plenty.

387
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
Which is still adequate.

388
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,880
Which is still adequate?

389
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,280
- Yes.
- Yep.

390
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,800
What's the difference between...

391
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,120
friendship and a girlfriend?

392
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,880
Girlfriends, they're more serious,

393
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,200
it's more intimate,

394
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
and there's no hands-to-yourself business.

395
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,456
Okay, hang on, hang on.

396
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,960
- So, it's more...
- Because that's...

397
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Tell me the difference.
It's more serious...

398
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,360
What do you mean by more serious?

399
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,256
- When I say serious...
- Yeah.

400
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,200
- ...you make the decision to...
- Yeah.

401
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,440
...to kiss each other or, um...

402
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,200
We don't talk to Mum and Dad
about kissing,

403
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,080
- do we?
- No.

404
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,640
N-Not... Not really.

405
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,576
I never really thought about that.

406
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
Because, you see, I've never...

407
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,760
never had any interest in having...
in having sexual intercourse as...

408
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,080
if you will. Um...

409
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,240
- Okay, this is where I exit.
- Yeah.

410
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,280
I have to say,
that could be a good time.

411
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,280
Thanks very much for coming.
We'll leave you guys to it.

412
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,840
And, like, one of my philosophies is,

413
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,000
never fall for a girl
just because she's hot.

414
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
I think that's an excellent philosophy.

415
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,800
- I made that up myself.
- Did you?

416
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,920
It's a good... It's a very good one.

417
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,840
So, when we're going on a first date,

418
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,960
what we're doing
is we're trying to find out

419
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,120
have we got enough things in...

420
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
- ...common.
- ...common.

421
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,800
What would be one thing
that you can think of

422
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,800
if you could make a girlfriend,

423
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,160
what would be something that you're into

424
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,520
and that she's into?

425
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,880
There is a hobby
that I enjoy doing.

426
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
I actually tend to do this one in secret.

427
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,040
That's toy collecting.

428
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,240
If you don't have
enough things in common,

429
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
what do we do?

430
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,640
Not bother with another date.

431
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,200
We don't just give up, we keep going,

432
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,096
- because we just have to keep finding...
- Yeah.

433
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,200
...that person that's gonna be your person

434
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,816
- with enough in common with you.
- Yeah.

435
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,680
I'd really like for you to let me know

436
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,160
how you go on your dates,

437
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,480
and especially to find out
if you've been able to find somebody

438
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,240
- that you have common interest with.
- Okay.

439
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Like... Likewise.

440
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,520
Take care of yourself.

441
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,920
- See ya.
- And good luck.

442
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
Thanks. Thanks for your time.

443
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,640
Are you open to dating people

444
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,600
who might have a disability
or a condition?

445
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,520
Oh, yes.

446
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,840
And I think dating someone
who's on the autistic spectrum,

447
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,160
or someone, you know, with disabilities
might be better.

448
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,000
I might... I might have, um...
be able to talk to them more about it

449
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,400
and not feel like I have to be fake

450
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,240
and be someone completely different.

451
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,000
<i>It's been almost two years</i>
<i>since Chloe has been on a date,</i>

452
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,640
<i>but that's about to change.</i>

453
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,960
Hello.

454
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,240
- Hello, miss.
- Yeah.

455
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,960
If you need to, just, you know,
twiddle your fingers or something,

456
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,640
if you're getting a little bit nervy.

457
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,560
And you can always excuse yourself,
you need to powder your nose or something.

458
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,920
Okay, but I don't have nose powder.

459
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,360
No, no. It's... It's a saying, isn't it.

460
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
- You go for... go for a wee.
- Oh, okay.

461
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,840
But it's not honest.

462
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,960
That's true. Maybe you could say,

463
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,256
- I'm just gonna just pop to the bathroom.
- Okay.

464
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,000
And you can have a little bit of time.

465
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,920
- Okay.
- All right?

466
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,080
Just... Just ask him what he likes, and...

467
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,920
boom, if there's a connection,
it's a connection.

468
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,640
Hmm.

469
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,160
<i>Chloe is meeting Marcus.</i>

470
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,000
<i>He likes playing drums...</i>

471
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,040
<i>and watching sunsets.</i>

472
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,920
<i>He hates thunderstorms...</i>

473
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,280
<i>...and the feeling of thongs
between his toes.</i>

474
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

475
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,720
I'm Chloe.

476
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,840
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

477
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,080
Here you go.

478
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,120
Oh, thank you so much. They're lovely.

479
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

480
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,160
So, how are you?

481
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,320
I'm pretty good.

482
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,320
Yeah?

483
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,760
You nervous?

484
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,200
Yeah, I am.

485
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,800
What do you like?
Do you have any hobbies?

486
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,240
I like to go to, um...

487
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,720
- to the gym.
- Oh, gym?

488
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,040
To be honest,
I have never set foot in a gym.

489
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,840
- Mmm.
- Never. Not my thing.

490
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,720
Yeah. So, do you like reading?

491
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,640
Like, do you know any good books?

492
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,960
I do read sometimes, but not a lot...

493
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,440
- Yeah.
- ...because, um...

494
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,440
Well, actually, I didn't learn
how to fully read until I was 13.

495
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,840
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

496
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,160
I couldn't speak
until I was seven.

497
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,480
I still have a lisp, but I'm deaf, so...

498
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,640
Oh, okay.

499
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,480
Autistic, deaf.

500
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

501
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,080
Can't speak properly.

502
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,080
Yeah, the whole package, I guess.

503
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,040
Um...

504
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,200
- Do you want to go inside for dinner?
- Yeah, sure.

505
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Okay.

506
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,240
Oh, she's pretty cool.
You know, it's going pretty well so far.

507
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,040
I hope it can...

508
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,760
only go up from here, you know?

509
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,560
So, have you ever, like, dated before?

510
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,480
Never.

511
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,760
- Oh, never?
- Never.

512
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,720
- This is the very first one...
- Oh, really?

513
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,400
- ...I've ever had, ever.
- Oh, really?

514
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

515
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,320
So, are you interested in, like,
any specific type of person or...

516
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,240
I thought I was interested in guys
at one point,

517
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,120
but then I tried watching
a little bit of, uh, gay porn, and...

518
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,080
- Okay.
- It didn't...

519
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,720
- It didn't work out.
- No? Okay.

520
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,160
And I did not like what I saw.

521
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,960
- Oh, okay.
- And I didn't feel anything.

522
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,440
So, you're sure
you're definitely straight?

523
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

524
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,320
How about you?

525
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,840
Um, well, I'm openly bi,

526
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,680
but I dated, uh, a few girls before,
a few guys, it's just,

527
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,000
you know, I'm just trying to find
the right person.

528
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,240
- True that.
- Yeah.

529
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,960
It's like, um... I like Asians.

530
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,960
- Oh, Asians?
- Yeah.

531
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,560
Okay.

532
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,400
- I'm a... I'm an Asian, and...
- Okay, yeah.

533
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm not Asian. Okay.

534
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
I also like Mexicans.

535
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,856
- I like them, too.
- Okay.

536
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,080
Yeah, okay.

537
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,560
- Yeah.
- My, um...

538
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,040
- Oh.
- Trout, guys?

539
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
Um, the steak and the... and the chips.

540
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,496
- Fish is right over here.
- Thank you.

541
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,360
Thank you.

542
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,120
- No worries. Enjoy, guys.
- That's what I'm talking about.

543
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,960
Do you like Spider-Man?

544
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,280
- Yeah, I do.
- Who's your favorite Spider-Man?

545
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,920
Um...

546
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,120
- Tobey Maguire.
- Oh.

547
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,016
- That is my favorite.
- Oh, you see...

548
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,320
I quite like Andrew Garfield,

549
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,480
but I think Tom Holland, the current one,
he's all right, but...

550
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,480
Yeah, he's, um...

551
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,280
- No, he's an actual kid, so...
- He's okay.

552
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,440
- He didn't tickle my fancy.
- I guess...

553
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
- Hmm.
- Hm.

554
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,560
This has been a really nice date,
but I think it's getting a bit late.

555
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

556
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,880
I had a nice time tonight. Thank you.
Thank you for the flowers, they're lovely.

557
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,320
- No problem.
- Thank you.

558
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,240
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

559
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,800
- Goodbye.
- Bye!

560
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,280
- Goodbye.
- Bye!

561
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,520
There wasn't really, like, a spark,
and it was a bit awkward for both of us.

562
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,360
It's kind of been, like,
a learning experience,

563
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,720
made me realize I like girls a bit more...

564
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,840
than men.

565
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,240
Are you guys in love?

566
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,280
- What'd he say?
- Are we in love?

567
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Um...

568
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,360
We're a bit more than in love.

569
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,120
Because we were a bit desperate,

570
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,680
when we hit rough roads...

571
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,920
...we just decide to cling on even more.

572
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,960
It's just nice and warm and comfortable
and stable now, I think.

573
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,640
- Steady.
- Yeah, yeah.

574
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,200
We're comfortable farting
in front of each other.

575
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, that.

576
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,080
Hello, Munchkin.

577
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,640
I've struggled my whole life
with friends,

578
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,400
and I've mostly really had friends
of the animal, imaginary kinds.

579
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,440
It would be nice to have
a real-life friend, I guess,

580
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,600
but I don't know if I will find one.

581
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,800
So, for the moment,
I've basically just latched onto Tom.

582
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,416
That... That one wasn't good enough.
We have to do it again.

583
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,080
- No, we don't!
- Yes, we do.

584
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,440
No, we certainly do not.

585
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,960
I love my job.

586
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,640
It's really relaxing just driving around,
looking at the scenery.

587
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,280
Initially, as a railway enthusiast,
I was a bit, "Ew, buses, they're common."

588
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
Very, uh, snobbish of me.

589
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,200
But I then thought,

590
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,616
you know, while I couldn't find work,
maybe give them a try.

591
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,240
And here I am,
and I absolutely love it, uh...

592
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,480
Best job I've ever had.

593
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,880
Just around the corner is a house

594
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,520
Ruth and I are currently dreaming
about buying.

595
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,600
Really nicely located
next to the railway station.

596
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,280
It'd be nice to spend the afternoon
on the balcony,

597
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,760
just watching the buses and the trains
driving past.

598
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,560
I saw the bus come along,
and I just jumped on...

599
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,496
...and then, for some reason,

600
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,880
Tom was in free dress...

601
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,760
...and I had no idea why.

602
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,760
Aren't you supposed to be in uniform?

603
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,040
What? What?

604
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
What?!

605
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,240
- Serious?
- Yeah.

606
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,856
I told you I couldn't afford a ring.
I already bought it.

607
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

608
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,520
- Really?!
- Oh, for goodness' sake, just put it on!

609
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,520
And say yes.

610
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Come here.

611
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,280
When it comes to physical beauty,

612
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,640
my idea is, a woman has to be beautiful,

613
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,520
but not to the point
where she looks like a model on a runway.

614
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,720
Definitely not. That's too beautiful.

615
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,560
Pretty much a fifty-fifty-looking girl.

616
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,320
That would be the best.

617
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,480
<i>Tonight, Michael is attending</i>
<i>a singles dinner in his local area.</i>

618
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,200
<i>It's the first of its kind to be run
by a local disability organization.</i>

619
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
- Hi, Michael.
- Hello, Tamika.

620
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,376
- How are you?
- I'm good, yourself?

621
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,560
I'm great.

622
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,560
So, what are your hobbies?

623
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,600
Ten-pin bowling, pool,

624
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,480
um, watching television...

625
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,480
Nice. Now, that's nice.

626
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,856
- Yeah.
- And what are yours?

627
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,160
Mine is basketball, soccer,

628
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,360
football...

629
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,400
Ever since I was a little girl,
I always used to love sport.

630
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,000
Ah, so you're a bit of a tomboy type.

631
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,280
Correct, I am.

632
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
Ah.

633
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,280
- Who's got the Mediterranean pasta?
- Here.

634
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Thank you.

635
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,256
- That's me.
- There you are.

636
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
Thank you.

637
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,560
Oh, have any of you seen
<i>SpongeBob SquarePants?</i>

638
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,560
Yes!

639
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,536
"Oh, SpongeBob.

640
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,680
If only you could see
how stupid you sound right now."

641
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,400
"I love money!

642
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,000
Money, money, money, money, money."

643
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,720
"Mistake? Ha!

644
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,160
The only mistake I ever made
was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab."

645
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,280
"But a visit
to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy!

646
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,040
And what could be better
than serving up smiles?"

647
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Mm-hmm.

648
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,480
Are you a beer drinker, Michael?

649
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,680
- Nope.
- No?

650
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,120
I've always hated beer.

651
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,400
I don't even drink wine either.
I hate it.

652
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,400
Oh, wow.

653
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,320
You see,
I'm a different kind of man.

654
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
I'm actually a teddy bear.

655
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,800
Aw, that's nice.

656
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
I like that.

657
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

658
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,000
Name's Michael.

659
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,040
Nice to meet you, Michael. I'm Carli.

660
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,320
Nice to meet you, Carli.

661
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,360
What do you do for work?

662
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,480
Um...

663
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,440
I... I run my own business.

664
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,040
Wow.

665
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,680
But sometimes
there have been complications.

666
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,040
Like, the financial side
on the business, it's...

667
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,000
become a bit, not blocked, but clogged up.

668
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,880
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

669
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,720
But I've asked a friend of mine,
"Ah, can you fix that?"

670
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,760
"Yeah, I'll fix it, I know what it is."

671
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,680
Ah.

672
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,840
So, I can easily deal with that,

673
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,760
- 'cause see...
- Yeah.

674
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,680
For instance, I've gotta do it
tomorrow morning, because I've...

675
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,320
Probably tomorrow afternoon.

676
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,080
See if I can keep going on the...

677
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,200
on the business stuff.

678
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,280
But if it has to wait till the weekend,
and then she sees it and goes,

679
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,480
- "Oh, yeah, I gotta fix that again."
- Yes.

680
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,080
So, it's a bit frustrating.

681
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,360
- Hello.
- Hi.

682
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,000
My name's Michael.

683
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,680
Michael. My name's Amanda.

684
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,520
You have a very lovely bow.

685
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Thank you.

686
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,400
And your hairstyle looks lovely as well.

687
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Thank you.

688
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,600
And, so, tell me,
what are your hobbies and interests?

689
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,040
I like to collect toys
and dolls and things.

690
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,880
- Seriously?
- Yep.

691
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,680
That's what I like doing as well!

692
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,800
Really?

693
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,360
I've collected a lot
of Thomas the Tank Engine...

694
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,200
You like Thomas the Tank Engine?

695
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,480
- Yeah.
- I liked it when I was a kid.

696
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,920
- Yeah.
- I still like it a bit now.

697
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah.

698
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,440
Do you have a favorite Thomas character?

699
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,400
- No, there's too many of them.
- Yeah.

700
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,640
So, how old are you?

701
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,880
I'm 25.

702
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,440
I'm 21.

703
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,360
Have you had your birthday yet?

704
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,320
- Thank you.
- No, it's next week.

705
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
Oh, so you're 22?

706
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Yeah, nearly.

707
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,000
So, you were born in 1997.

708
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,400
Same year <i>Men In Black</i> was released.

709
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,720
Is that a movie?

710
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,080
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

711
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,800
You've heard of Asperger's?

712
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Yes.

713
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,960
I actually have it.

714
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,280
So do I.

715
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,640
But mine's mild.

716
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,880
So is mine.

717
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,000
Wow.

718
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,560
I was 13 when I got a diagnosis,

719
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,960
so it was my first year of high school.

720
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,600
I never knew I had Asperger's
until my mother told me when I was 13.

721
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,360
That's not too bad.

722
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,400
Did she know
when you were younger, though?

723
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
I think so, but I don't know when.

724
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,160
- Yeah.
- When I was in primary school,

725
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,840
I often sat alone.

726
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Yeah.

727
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,200
Do you mind if I ask you something?

728
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,520
- Yeah?
- Um...

729
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,560
I actually enjoy... enjoy talking to you.

730
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Me too.

731
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,000
I'd like to catch up with you
again sometime.

732
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,720
You never know...

733
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
What do you say?

734
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Nice.

735
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,080
Hello.

736
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,160
How's Cleo?

737
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,520
- What'd he say?
- How is Cleo?

738
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,520
She's all right.
She had a shed last night.

739
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,480
Do you want me to show you the s-skin?

740
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,400
Yeah.

741
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
All right.

742
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,800
Got a surprise for her planned.
She doesn't know yet.

743
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,520
It's the skin.

744
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,680
- Whoa.
- I'm very proud of my little girl.

745
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,120
How do you feel
about four years together?

746
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,840
Yeah, it's cool.

747
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
No need to sound so excited.

748
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,080
Sorry, I'm just... quietly elated.

749
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,680
You're a goose.

750
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,520
It's like making out with Medusa.

751
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,320
That's me.

752
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,040
- Hello, Thomas. Hello, Ruth.
- Hello.

753
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,200
Congratulations
on your fourth anniversary.

754
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,560
- What's going on?
- We're going on a date.

755
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,520
Is that a Rolls-Royce with coach doors?

756
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,200
- This one's a vintage 1928 Chrysler.
- What did he say?

757
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,680
It's a Chrysler,
but we won't hold that against him.

758
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
No, we won't.

759
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,080
- Thanks very much.
- My pleasure.

760
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,040
- Do you have a business card?
- I do.

761
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,040
- Thanks. Can I have one?
- You sure can.

762
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,936
- There you go.
- Brilliant! Thank you so much.

763
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,080
- My pleasure. Enjoy your evening.
- Cheers!

764
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
What the...?

765
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,520
Oh.

766
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Hmm.

767
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Yeah.

768
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,000
Isn't this nice?

769
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,280
It's very à la <i>The Bachelor.</i>

770
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,520
- But it's still very cute.
- Well...

771
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,920
Well, very <i>Bachelor,</i>
because it's entirely scripted.

772
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,880
Where's my script?

773
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,920
- Didn't you get it?
- No!

774
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,080
Who didn't email Ruth her script?

775
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,240
Sorry, I forgot.

776
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,240
I wish I saw the warning signs

777
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,920
when I met you.

778
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,080
- I never professed to be a lady.
- Good.

779
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Oh, that hurts.

780
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Oh.

781
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,520
You're a cutie patootie.

782
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,800
And you have a cute patootie as well.

783
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,440
Thanks.

784
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,440
You're a really special girl, Ruth.
You're very different and very unique.

785
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,200
Well, you're a handsome boy.

786
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,880
- I am a handsome boy.
- You are.

787
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,200
I'm a bit nervous,

788
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,800
but excited.

789
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,360
Hopefully it'll be love at first sight,
or whatever.

790
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,920
You know, like in the movies.

791
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,840
<i>After an unsuccessful</i>
<i>first date with Marcus,</i>

792
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,560
<i>Chloe is changing tack.</i>

793
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,960
<i>Chloe's date is with Lotus.</i>

794
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,440
<i>Lotus loves drag queens...</i>

795
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,280
<i>...and the sound of parrots eating.</i>

796
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,840
<i>She hates people talking all at once...</i>

797
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,280
<i>...and loud machinery.</i>

798
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,840
Hi, are you Chloe?

799
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,480
Oh, yeah, I'm Chloe. Are you Lotus?

800
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,920
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

801
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,840
Hi.

802
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,640
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, please.

803
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,920
So, um, what kind of stuff are you into,
like, movies and stuff?

804
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,680
Um, I sort of...

805
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,640
- I like <i>Sailor Moon, </i>you know, the anime.
- Oh!

806
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,656
- I love <i>Sailor Moon. </i>
<i>- </i>You're into anime?

807
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,520
- Yeah.
- Me too.

808
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,280
- You do?
- I kind of stopped watching it for ages,

809
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,400
and then got back into it.

810
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Oh, it's raining.

811
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,520
Okay, I'm gonna put my jacket on.

812
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,240
- I'm just getting cold.
- Yeah.

813
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,360
So are you, like, bi or lesbian?

814
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,480
- Yeah, I'm bisexual. I'm both.
- Okay. Yeah?

815
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
I thought I was, like, a lesbian
for the biggest time,

816
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,920
because I didn't feel
any attraction towards boys.

817
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,400
Yeah. I started to think, maybe it was
'cause the boys at my school were gross.

818
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,400
Um...

819
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,120
So, are you on the spectrum, too?

820
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,720
Yes. I didn't get diagnosed
until I was, like, 12.

821
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,016
'Cause, you know, sometimes with girls
on the spectrum...

822
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,976
- It's harder to...
- Yeah, you get diagnosed later.

823
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Hello. We've got a mixed berry smoothie.

824
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,280
- That's me, thank you.
- And the iced...

825
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,200
And the iced choccy.

826
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,480
- Thank you.
- No worries.

827
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,840
Yeah, it was kind of weird.

828
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,360
When I was acting out, they didn't know
what was wrong with me.

829
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,560
They thought I was doing that

830
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,096
- because my parents got divorced.
- Oh.

831
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,560
They were always like,
"The kid's just going through a phase."

832
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,520
Like, I had sensory problems,
so I couldn't wear the socks,

833
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,880
and I couldn't wear the sweater,

834
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,280
and the school was like,
"Oh, she's just being annoying..."

835
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,640
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, and...

836
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I was hated at my school,
absolutely hated,

837
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,240
because I would...
No one knew, really, what to do.

838
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,600
So, there's a sunflower farm,
um, down the road.

839
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,120
- Would you like to go and pick sunflowers?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

840
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,680
What's your favorite flower?

841
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,440
- Well, my name's Lotus, so...
- Oh, lotus.

842
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,520
- So probably a lotus.
- Yeah. I get it.

843
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,920
- So, which way's the sunflower park?
- Oh, down there.

844
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Alrighty.

845
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,920
- I wore the wrong shoes for this.
- Oh, so did I. Oh, God.

846
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Not to be lame,
but this reminds me of <i>Minecraft.</i>

847
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,280
Oh.

848
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,080
Haha, yes,
the autistic girl likes <i>Minecraft.</i>

849
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,280
- This is cool. Like a little hidden spot.
- Yeah.

850
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Feel that.

851
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,640
Kinda hurts.

852
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,480
Uh...

853
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,800
I think it's going well.
You know, a lot better than I expected.

854
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,240
I really like her, you know.

855
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,960
We're, um, talking, getting along.

856
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,480
I was expecting, you know,
sort of awkwardness,

857
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,040
and that we wouldn't
have anything to talk about and...

858
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,920
Yeah, but we've just been
non-stop talking.

859
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,840
Got it, thank you.

860
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,800
I think I got
a little bit nervous,

861
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,960
and I have trouble talking
when I'm nervous,

862
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,080
but I'm hoping that maybe she got that.

863
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,520
I just hope she knows that's the case,
and not that I was like,

864
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,976
- "I don't wanna be here."
- Do you see Chloe as someone

865
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,720
- you could potentially date?
- Yes.

866
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,240
Yeah, um...

867
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,960
Yeah, it'd be cool
if she thought the same thing.

868
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,720
That looks like a little love heart.

869
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
- Oh, it does!
- Yeah.

870
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,880
- Quite cute.
- Yeah.

871
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
Are you...

872
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,520
Are you all right?

873
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,320
Oh, yeah, I'm good, sorry.
I'm just spacing out. Um...

874
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,840
- Alrighty, um...
- Okay.

875
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Uh...

876
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,920
Do you want this one?

877
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,336
- Oh, no, you can keep it.
- Really?

878
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,840
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

879
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,280
- It's cute, I'll put it in my vase.
- Yeah.

880
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
Um, well, my mum's here
to pick me up. Uh...

881
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,416
- It was really nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you, too.

882
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,320
- It'd be cool to see you again.
- Oh, yeah. I would really like that.

883
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,000
- Oh, really? Okay, cool.
- Really, yeah.

884
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,160
I was really worried,
I didn't know if you liked me.

885
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,120
I was... I was worried too,
but that's really good. All right, um...

886
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,440
- Thank you. See ya!
- Bye!

887
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

888
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,360
- Are you happy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

889
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,320
Yeah. Yeah.

890
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,720
Yeah.

891
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,680
Oh, I can't stop smiling.

892
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,160
Yeah.

893
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,960
Can you describe for me
the perfect relationship?

894
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,320
Well, no relationship is perfect,

895
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,800
because perfection in a relationship
cannot exist in any way.

896
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,920
But you can make a relationship

897
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,120
a very healthy, stable,
loving relationship.

898
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,840
And whenever a person
is feeling bored or unhappy

899
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,560
in their relationship with someone,

900
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,720
all they need to do is stop
and do one thing that everyone should do:

901
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,080
smell the flowers.

902
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,680
They don't bloom every day.

903
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,040
<i>Michael is getting ready</i>
<i>for dinner with Amanda.</i>

904
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,160
<i>It will be his first ever date.</i>

905
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,656
- Wow, how good do you look?
- Million bucks.

906
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,336
- That's what I wanna hear.
- Jeez, I love your shoes, mate.

907
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,200
Thanks, Dad.

908
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,160
- She'll be impressed.
- Yep.

909
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,360
Speaking of which, this bit of paper
that Adam gave me,

910
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,160
I'll be keeping this on my person.

911
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
What is it?

912
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,040
Just dating points.

913
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,680
- Oh, okay.
- Dating advice.

914
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,760
"Be yourself, above all else.

915
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,000
Remain focused on your date.

916
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,640
Look for changes in the way she responds

917
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,760
to indicate if she's interested
in the conversation.

918
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,040
If she gives you short responses
with a flat tone,

919
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,240
take this as a sign to change the topic.

920
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,480
Keep your face relaxed
while maintaining eye contact."

921
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,560
Adam's a smart boy.

922
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,480
- Indeed, he is.
- He gets it off me.

923
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,880
Yes.

924
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,640
Most guys wouldn't even think
about all that sort of stuff.

925
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,480
I wonder why.

926
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,160
Because that's the way
we've been created, I guess.

927
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,640
Yes, but I want to be different
from all men.

928
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,960
In what way?

929
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,640
An A-plus partner

930
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,000
looks like me.

931
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,056
- I'm saying it because it's accurate, Mum.
- Yeah.

932
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,280
Far-out, Mike.

933
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,440
- And...
- He's cute.

934
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,240
...when I do get married in the future,

935
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,960
not only will my wife be
my most crowning achievement, but also,

936
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,880
I've actually envisioned
a lot of family members in the future

937
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,360
saying this...
these words to my wife af...

938
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,760
after my passing.

939
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,920
- What the hell?
- After your passing?

940
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,320
"Being your husband...

941
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,280
nothing made that man any happier."

942
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,720
Mate...

943
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,376
- You're thinking too far ahead, mate.
- Dad, I always think ahead.

944
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,080
Yeah, but that's a bit too far.

945
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,240
Excuse me, everyone.
I need to do my final preparations

946
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,496
- for the date.
- Okay.

947
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
Thank you.

948
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,840
So cute.

949
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,600
Okay, which one?

950
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,080
Ah-ha!

951
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,800
Don't wanna be late!

952
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,080
I know, I'm coming.

953
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,480
Don't forget the rose.

954
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,360
- I won't forget that either, Mum.
- Okay.

955
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,336
- No problem.
- Don't forget your wallet.

956
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,920
Nope. I never forget that, either.

957
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,800
My... My hair comb.

958
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,560
Um, just... Just bear with me
for a couple of minutes.

959
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,040
We'll be there, we'll be there!

960
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,320
It's all right, Mike.

961
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
Ready.

962
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,896
- Okay.
- Ready?

963
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,160
Yep, ready.

964
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
Good stuff.

965
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,320
All right, well, all the best, Michael.

966
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,440
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Dad.

967
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,840
Thank you.

968
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,080
Take care, Dad.

969
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,600
Good. Now get outta here.

970
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,936
- Yep, see ya, Dad.
- Nice flower, by the way, too.

971
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,296
- See ya.
- Remember your brother's advice.

972
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,560
Got it! Got it.

973
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,080
- Ah, thank you.
- You're welcome.

974
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,040
- Thank you.
- Would you like some table water?

975
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,720
Uh, yes please, thank... thank...

976
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,880
Please and thank you.

977
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
You all right?

978
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,520
Just can't believe that this is happening.

979
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,160
Little nervous.

980
00:45:38,184 --> 00:45:41,184
