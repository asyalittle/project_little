00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,280
[narrator] <i>It's been two weeks</i>
<i>since Andrew matched with Evie</i>

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,600
<i>after meeting her at a speed dating event,</i>

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,680
<i>and he's received some news.</i>

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,520
[Andrew] "Hi. I'm really sorry,
but I can't go out with you today,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,280
or for a while.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,920
I'm going through
some very personal stuff.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,560
Sorry for wasting your time. Evie."

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,040
Um, I...

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,800
And then I replied back, saying, um,

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,960
"Hi, Evie. Not a problem.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,440
I totally understand.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,800
Let me know
when you are feeling much better,

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,160
if you want to catch up for a coffee."

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
And then, that's it.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,320
[Cian] It sounded like things
were looking good, and then...

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,480
she changed her mind?

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Yes.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
[Cian] Hi.

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,320
Hi, I'm Sharnae, and I'm 21 years old,

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,120
and I'm on the spectrum.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,800
[Cian] Describe for me
what your ideal partner would be like.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,360
Caring, amazing,

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
good-looking.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Jimmy?

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
Come here.

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,560
[giggles] Hello.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Hello.

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,400
[whispers] Say your name.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,480
- James.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,960
You have to look at him.

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,160
[inhales deeply]

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,960
[exhales]

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Hey.

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,120
- [Cian] You feeling a bit stressed?
- [whispers] I can't do it. I'm struggling.

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,160
I'm here. Look at me.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Hello. We'll do it together.

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,800
[Cian] How long have you
known each other?

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,800
- Two years. Yeah, two.
- A-Almost three.

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,360
Almost three years. Yeah.

41
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,680
[Cian] What did you think
when you first met, Jimmy?

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,360
[chuckles] That Sharnae
just thought I was attractive.

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,560
[laughing] Yeah. I did.

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
He's sexy.

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,120
I was just, like, "Mum,
there's this hot guy at Job Centre.

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,720
I... I'm gonna ask him out."

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
At that point, I didn't even know
I was on the spectrum.

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,160
I just knew I was different.

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,080
And Sharnae just...

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,000
She just felt similar to me, but...

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,080
more like she just knew what I was...
what I was thinking.

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,000
Even before I was diagnosed,
she just called me autistic,

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,216
- or told everyone I was autistic...
- Yeah. Pretty much.

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,000
- ...'cause she believed it so much.
- I did.

55
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,160
[Cian] How old were you
when diagnosed, Jimmy?

56
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
Well, I was 20. I'm 21 now.

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
[Cian] Wow.

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't know how they missed it.

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,280
[Cian] What did you think
when you were diagnosed?

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I didn't change.

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
[both laugh]

62
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,840
[Cian] Why do you think you guys
are compatible?

63
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,520
[whispers] What's that mean?

64
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,040
- [Cian] Are you compatible?
- I hope so. [laughs]

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,776
- What does "compatible" mean?
- Compatible means, uh, do we have...

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,120
Do we... Do we go well together?

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,520
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I didn't know
what that word meant.

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,920
Yes, we do. We were made for each other.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,880
I love Sharnae.

70
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
I love Jimmy.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,120
- [Jimmy chuckles]
- Ooh.

72
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,040
[Sharnae laughs]

73
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,720
[narrator] <i>It's a special day</i>
<i>for the young couple.</i>

74
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,880
<i>- They're moving in together.</i>
- [Jimmy] I've got you.

75
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
- [Jimmy laughs]
- Ooh, thank you.

76
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
That's okay.

77
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,960
Yep, and put that in the cupboard.

78
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,800
[Cian] So, there's two knives
and two forks?

79
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,800
- [Sharnae] Yeah, and two plates.
- [Jimmy] Yes.

80
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,360
[Cian] What if you have guests?

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,400
- They can bring their own.
- Paper plates.

82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,640
- [Jimmy laughs] Or bring their own.
- Or bring their own plates and cutlery.

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,920
It makes sense.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
- It does.
- Yeah.

85
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,840
- [Jimmy] Yeah.
- [Cian] Did Sharnae make that?

86
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
[Jimmy] Yeah.

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
[loud clattering]

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,800
- [Jimmy] Jesus Christ. [laughs]
- [Sharnae laughs]

89
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,240
[Cian] Oh, goodness, what's this?

90
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,480
[Sharnae] Oh, wanna see it?

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,440
[Jimmy laughing]

92
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,360
[Sharnae laughs]

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
- [Jimmy] Me and her, printed on a blanket.
- Yeah.

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,080
It's really soft, too.

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,880
So it's sensory.

96
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,760
We like that kinda stuff,
'cause, yes, we're autistic,

97
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
so we like sensory stuff.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,240
[Cian] Why do you put
the eye masks on them?

99
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,160
- I don't know. It's just happy there.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,880
- It feels right.
- [Sharnae] Yeah.

101
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,800
[Cian] Would you say
this is a big step in your relationship?

102
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,560
- Oh, yes. Yeah, very big.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,920
Yeah, the biggest so far.

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,240
We've been wanting to do it
for ages now, so...

105
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,120
about time we move in together.

106
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,640
Found a house, perfect.

108
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah.

109
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,720
- [Cian] What's all this, Jimmy?
- [Jimmy] They're all my puzzles.

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,520
[whispering indistinctly]

111
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,440
- [Sharnae] He lines it all up.
- [Jimmy] I was making sure it was nice.

112
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
[Sharnae] It looks good.

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,840
[Cian] How long does it take
to solve a Rubik's Cube?

114
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
I like to get sub-one-minute, but...

115
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,880
mostly around the one-minute mark.

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,240
[Cian] What is it you love
about doing these puzzles?

117
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,200
[Jimmy] I don't know,
they're kind of just cool.

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,680
I originally got the Rubik's Cube

119
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,840
to keep my fingers and hands busy
when I'm anxious,

120
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,840
and I still like them.

121
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
- [Cian] Did you just finish it?
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
[Cian] So you like solving things

123
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,000
- in your brain.
- I like to solve things in my brain, yeah.

124
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,160
I see pool like that, as well.

125
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,000
Every rack is a different puzzle.

126
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,400
I c... I see it all
before it all goes down.

127
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,280
They're small, easy puzzles,
but they're still puzzles.

128
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
[horn honks]

129
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,080
That must be my pool table.

130
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
[Sharnae] Yeah, let's go see it!

131
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
- Dun-da-da!
- Okay.

132
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,520
- Come on, hold my hand.
- Okay.

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,880
- Come on.
- [Jimmy] Okay.

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,200
- [Sharnae] Hello.
- [man] Hi. Where are we going?

135
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
- Out the back?
- That way.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
- Yeah?
- Yep.

137
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,680
[narrator] <i>To house his prized possession,</i>

138
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,400
<i>Jimmy has set up a marquee
in his backyard.</i>

139
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
[Sharnae hums]

140
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,120
Wow, there we go.

141
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,560
[Jimmy] It definitely fits, then.

142
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,720
[Cian] Are you a pro player, Jimmy?

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
- [Jimmy laughing] Nope.
- Yes.

144
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
[Sharnae] You've only been playing pool
for like...

145
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
- Two years.
- Yeah.

146
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,000
[Cian] Only two years?
That's not long.

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,840
- No, it's not.
- He's already off the rails.

148
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,000
Like, really, really good.

149
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,480
It's possible that it's an obsession.
It's all I can think about, so...

150
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
[chuckles]

151
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,560
[Cian] Just Sharnae and pool.

152
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
- Yeah.
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

153
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,160
Yep. Indeed.

154
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
[Cian] Do you guys remember
your first date?

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Yes.

156
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
The movies.

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,480
[Cian] Did you watch the movie?

158
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,960
Obviously, it's a cinema.

160
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,880
[both laugh]

161
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,560
Why else would you go to the movies?

162
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,400
Some do it to make out,
that's what he meant.

163
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah.

164
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,496
- That's what he meant, isn't it?
- No.

165
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,656
- The movies are too good.
- Yeah, it was a good movie.

166
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,560
- We holded hands the whole time...
- Held.

167
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,760
<i>Held </i>hands, thank you.

168
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,640
We hold han... held hands the whole time,
and our arms were getting dead.

169
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
And pins and needles, really hurting.

170
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,960
That's what we thought that you do
on first dates.

171
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,120
- I wasn't... I wasn't sure of the protocol.
- Yeah.

172
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,336
I didn't know,
because I'd never been on a date before,

173
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,120
so I thought it was normal too. So...

174
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,120
And then we kissed on the first date,
too, so...

175
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,320
- [Cian] Ooh.
- Yeah.

176
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,840
And then pretty much after that,
he asked me out.

177
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Straight after.

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
And then we were official.

179
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,400
Isn't that right?
And then Facebook official.

180
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,880
- [laughs]
- [clicks tongue]

181
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,120
[laughs]

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,336
- I don't like kissing. Kissing's scary.
- [Sharnae] Don't do tongue.

183
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
No, I just don't like it.
It just feels weird.

184
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
It's like a lizard.

185
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Stop that.

186
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,200
[Sharnae and Jimmy laughing]

187
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,480
- We do kiss.
- [Jimmy] Oh, nah...

188
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,280
- [Sharnae] Yeah, we do.
- [Jimmy laughing]

189
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
We do.

190
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,041
- [Jimmy] Yeah, of course.
- And we hold hands for, like, ten seconds.

191
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,136
- [Jimmy] About.
- About ten.

192
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,520
Five to ten seconds,

193
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,856
- never above ten, but never below five.
- [Sharnae] Yeah.

194
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,320
True that, yeah.

195
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,800
And I'm fine with that.

196
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,440
I don't... I don't really mind.

197
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
[Cian] Is intimacy important
in a relationship?

198
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,040
- Intimacy... Intimacy's easy.
- Yeah.

199
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Yeah, it's easy.

200
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
[Cian] You don't have to answer.

201
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,960
Have you guys consummated
your relationship?

202
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,256
- [whispers] What's that mean?
- [whispers] I have no idea.

203
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,040
No, I actually do know what it means.

204
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
[whispers] Tell me.

205
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
[whispers] Guess.

206
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,160
- Yes.
- [chuckles]

207
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,840
Obviously.

208
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,440
[both laugh]

209
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,960
- As I said, it's easy. That stuff's easy.
- Yeah.

210
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,160
[Sharnae laughs]

211
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,760
[Cian] What do you think would be
the biggest challenge for you

212
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
in dating, or in a relationship?

213
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,000
Probably, um, that, um... [clicks tongue]

214
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,960
uh, good conversation,
and especially eye contact as well.

215
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,280
[Cian] So, communication?

216
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,680
Uh, yes.

217
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
[narrator] <i>To help Andrew</i>
<i>in his search for love,</i>

218
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,800
<i>relationship specialist Jodi Rodgers
has come to work with him</i>

219
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,400
<i>- on his dating skills.</i>
- [knocking]

220
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,280
[Andrew] Hi, I'm Andrew.

221
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,920
Come in.

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
Nice to meet you. I'm Jodi.

223
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,920
[Andrew] Jodi, nice to meet you.
Come... Come on in.

224
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,160
[Jodi] I absolutely love working
with people on the autism spectrum,

225
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,640
because every single person
is really different,

226
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,920
and the things that they're skilled at,

227
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,880
or their special interests
are really amazing.

228
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,040
I learn something different
about being on the spectrum

229
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,880
from every single person that I meet.

230
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,520
All right, so...

231
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,320
what do you want a girlfriend for?

232
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,000
Just, um, like, um,
start my own family and that.

233
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
To be a good father,

234
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,160
and also to keep the family name going
and that...

235
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,960
That's a very traditional way of thinking,
isn't it?

236
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,880
Yes.

237
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,080
So, what's the very first step
for this plan?

238
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,640
It's get a girlfriend.

239
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

240
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,440
So, when you went on the speed dating,
did you meet anyone?

241
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,440
Um, there... there was this, um, young,
um, lady by the name of Evie.

242
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,960
But then she came down with some, um,
like, personal issues and that.

243
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,760
So, I... I do have the, um, text here.

244
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
So...

245
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,080
So, just, um, from that there.

246
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,720
"Hi, I'm really sorry,

247
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,080
but I can't go out with you today,
or for a while."

248
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,480
Oh. How did...
When you get a message like that...

249
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,000
- Yep.
- ...what did you think?

250
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,560
Um, I felt a... a bit down,
and a bit, um, upset and that.

251
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

252
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,360
Do you think that that means there is
a future possibility of going out,

253
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,760
or do you think that means
that's the end of this?

254
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,280
I think maybe there'll be a possibility
in the... the future and that.

255
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,360
But sometimes the words
that come out of our mouth...

256
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,880
- Yeah.
- ...are not really what we're thinking.

257
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,800
When somebody actually says,

258
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,240
"I'm so sorry,

259
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,880
I can't get together...

260
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,160
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot...

261
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,160
for a while,"

262
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,200
what do you think she's thinking?

263
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,840
Mmm. [exhales]

264
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,640
Yeah, that's a really hard question.

265
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,000
This is the... one of the hardest parts
about relationships.

266
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Because...

267
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
in her mind,
she was probably thinking to herself,

268
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,600
"I like the look of that Andrew fella."

269
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,040
And then she's thinking,

270
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,040
[smacks lips] "But maybe
he's not boyfriend material."

271
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,960
Okay.

272
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,120
We're strange, humans.

273
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,040
Because rather
than just sending a text saying,

274
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,600
- "Great to get to know you...
- Yeah.

275
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,160
- ...but you are not boyfriend material."
- [Andrew] Hmm.

276
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Instead of saying things
how they really are,

277
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,120
what we do is we try

278
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,040
and make another person feel okay.

279
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
[Andrew] Okay. Yep.

280
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,840
And do you think Evie

281
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,240
- wanted to hurt your feelings?
- No, she...

282
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,560
- No way!
- No.

283
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,120
How many dates had you been on
before meeting Evie

284
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,560
- at speed dating?
- None.

285
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,720
- None?!
- No.

286
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,400
It takes a lot of dates

287
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,320
- before you find the right person for you.
- Yes.

288
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,280
- Doesn't it?
- Mmm.

289
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,800
So, that's good practice

290
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,840
- for the next date that's gonna happen.
- Okay.

291
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
Do you find body language difficult?

292
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,760
I think, um, when I was in school,
um, yes.

293
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,400
I don't know if I still do, actually.

294
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay, so if you wanted to show a girl

295
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,880
that you're really into what she's saying,
what would you do with your face?

296
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,640
That's quite good. I like the...

297
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
- the eyes opening up like this.
- Mmm.

298
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,880
If you're going to meet someone,
do you practice?

299
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,960
I think, like, I normally have
like a script in my head,

300
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,760
like what questions
I'm going to ask her and that.

301
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,920
All right, so tell me the questions

302
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,280
when you would go on a...
a date with somebody.

303
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,040
[Andrew] How old are they.

304
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,480
Um, do you work?

305
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,880
Um, do you have any hobbies that you like?

306
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,480
Do you live with your, um, parents?

307
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
[Jodi] All right,
so here's your list of questions.

308
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,440
- You take hold of that one.
- Yep.

309
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,880
I'm meeting you for the first time,

310
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,880
so I'm gonna have a list of questions,
too, in my head, that are important.

311
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,640
All right, you start the conversation,

312
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,960
and we'll see if you can actually
keep it going.

313
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,680
Yep. Okay, how old are you?

314
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,200
Twenty-one.

315
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,760
[chuckles] I'm 28 years old.

316
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,000
Um, what do you do for work?

317
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,760
I work with plants.

318
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,120
Um, do you have any hobbies or interests?

319
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,320
I like going to the gym...

320
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,240
and I like doing jigsaw puzzles.

321
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,280
Oh, very good.
I like doing jigsaw puzzles as well.

322
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,640
Um...

323
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,200
Do you live with your parents
or do you live by yourself?

324
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,960
I live by myself.

325
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
[Andrew] Okay.

326
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Hmm.

327
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,320
- That's about it.
- [Jodi laughs]

328
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,280
Yeah, I know.

329
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,800
- It's hard, isn't it?
- I know, very hard and that.

330
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,440
Every time...

331
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,760
- there's a question...
- [Andrew] Yep.

332
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,520
[Jodi] ...and we have an answer,
we think to ourselves,

333
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,880
"How could I keep them

334
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,000
- talking about that?"
- Hmm.

335
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,520
Because otherwise, we go on a date,

336
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,320
- we have four questions...
- Yeah.

337
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,320
...the date could be finished
in three minutes.

338
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,520
So let's practice again.

339
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,320
H-How old are you?

340
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
I am 21.

341
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
[Andrew] Hmm.

342
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,600
- Have you had your 21st birthday yet?
- Excellent! There you go.

343
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,640
Oh, yes,
I had a great 21st birthday party.

344
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,120
- [Andrew] Hmm.
- Three of my friends

345
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,560
went to the movies.

346
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Okay.

347
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,920
When you did go to the movies
with your friends,

348
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,360
what movie did you go and see?

349
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,720
You're good. That's excellent.

350
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,560
I went and saw <i>Fast and the Furious 3.</i>

351
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,560
Oh! Well, that...

352
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,680
I like the <i>Fast and the Furious,</i>
um, movies.

353
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,680
I prefer, uh, number six, actually.

354
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
Look at us. What have we just
found out together?

355
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,800
- Very interested in movies.
- How did you show me with your face?

356
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,280
Ah, well done!

357
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,480
Up with your eyebrows. You... I saw it.

358
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
So you need to know, you can do this.

359
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,200
Autism isn't stagnant.

360
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,560
People develop, and they change,

361
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,160
and you can see with Andrew
that he's learnt a lot of skill

362
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,600
about social connection with other people.

363
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,200
But it's quite rigid.

364
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Thank you for coming
and, um, teaching me some things.

365
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,520
Andrew needs support to understand
how do we follow and continue

366
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,240
and keep a conversation going
with another person,

367
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,480
so a date doesn't finish
in three and a half seconds

368
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,400
and feel like an interrogation.

369
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,480
And, um, have a good day.

370
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,840
[Jodi] Thank you. See you later.

371
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
See you, Jodi.

372
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,160
[Cian] What's the hardest thing
about being on the spectrum?

373
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,720
We do get major anxiety.

374
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,680
We get busy heads.

375
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,440
So sometimes, you know,
like a roller coaster.

376
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,360
Well, it's just...

377
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,160
I think it's just annoying
when other people

378
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,936
- just don't see what I see.
- [Sharnae] Hmm.

379
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,040
[Cian] Is change hard to deal with?

380
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,200
- Change is like a bad holiday.
- [Sharnae] Yeah.

381
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,200
I like holidays,

382
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,920
- but I don't like changes much.
- Change.

383
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
- I like planned change.
- [Sharnae] Yeah.

384
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,280
So if you can plan change,

385
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,440
- it's very, very good.
- Easier. And if we...

386
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,840
Yeah, if we get it on the spot,
we're like, "Oh," you know?

387
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,856
- Yeah, it freaks me out.
- Yeah, it freaks us out.

388
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,376
- Sometimes it will...
- [Sharnae] Yeah.

389
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
- ...ruin my whole night, even for pool.
- Yeah.

390
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,560
I'll turn up expecting one thing,
and then something might go wrong,

391
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,720
and it will make the whole night
a lot harder. [exhales]

392

398
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,680

- [Cian] You don't have to, Jimmy.

399
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,280
I just can't.

400
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,080
Maybe in different circumstances.

401
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,800
I just don't... think so.

402
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,520
[Sharnae] You don't think so?
Wanna have a drink, see how you feel?

403
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,416
- I want lemon, lime, and bitters.
- Lemon, lime, and bitters now?

404
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,800
- Yes.
- Yes, okay.

405
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,280
[Cian] Is it that you don't want
to play pool, or...?

406
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,160
I want to play pool, I just don't...

407
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
think so.

408
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,840
[Cian] Is it 'cause we're here?
Or is it 'cause there's...

409
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,680
- People.
- [Cian] People you don't know?

410
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,960
I don't know these guys.

411
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,080
If it was like a normal night,
everyone in this...

412
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,680
this whole room, I would know.

413
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,760
But it's not like that at all.

[people cheering]

415
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,800
I don't know if I can do this.

I don't know...

417
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,000

A little bit of freak-out, yeah?

420
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,320
No, I'm having a lot of bit of freak-out.

421
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320

[Cian] How are you feeling
about the dates you went on?

444
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,320
There were a couple of things
where my filter got in the way.

445
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,040
A couple of things where I was wishing...

446
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,760
Internally wishing I hadn't said it,
and stuff like that.

447
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
First dates never really go...
never... never really are good, are they?

[Cian] What's autism
feel like for you?

449
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,720
It's like being in a transparent box.

450
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,160
No one can hear you, no one can...

451
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
They can see you,
but they can't interact with you.

452
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,336
You can bang on the wall,
but you can't get out of it,

453
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,800
so it's very lonely being in the box
your entire life.

'Cause no one can get in,

00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,200
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too. You look lovely.

469
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,360
Thank you.

470
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,080
- Well, yes.
- Yeah.

471
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
Bit hard to sit down on these chairs.

472
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,640
Whereabouts in Central Coast are you from?

473
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,040
- Gosford.
- So am I!

474
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
I live in North Gosford.

475
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,560
- Oh, really? No way!
- Yes.

476
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,960
- So close to each other. That's so weird.
- [Jackson] Yeah, it is weird, isn't it?

477
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,880
- What do you like to do?
- I'm a gamer.

478
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,840
What sort of games?

479
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,600
Planning to get
the new <i>Mortal Kombat</i> game.

480
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,280
Oh, that's a good game, yeah.

481
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
[both chuckle]

482
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,160
So, like, anything else you do,
like your hobbies, or...?

483
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,120
Um, well, I'm an actor.

484
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,320
- Oh, are you? Wow.
- Yes, with a theater company

485
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,920
- for disabled people.
- Really?

486
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,040
- Yeah.
- Oh, cool.

487
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,720
My autism helps me with that a lot.

488
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,200
Also, being very emotional,

489
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,080
which comes from my autism, so...
[chuckles]

490
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,600
My, uh, autism gives me
a very creative side.

491
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,240
- Yeah.
- Uh, but I also have very high thinking,

492
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,480
but I'm, like, slow, uh, motor speeds.

493
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,456
When I was really little, I used to just
go round banging my head on shit,

494
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,800
- just for the fun of it.
- [laughs]

495
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,136
- Would you like to get a drink or coffee?
- I don't drink coffee, I'd like a drink.

496
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,760
- Yeah. I'll go get you one.
- Yeah.

497
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,640
- [Jackson] I'll be back in just a sec.
- Yep.

498
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,360
- [Cian] So, what do you think?
- I'm liking.

499
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,400
I know you've been wanting to hear that
for about three dates now. [laughs]

500
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Here you are.

501
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,480
[quacking]

502
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,560
I wasn't diagnosed till I was 18.

503
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,040
Yeah, about the same for me.
I think 19, maybe.

504
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,080
[Olivia] It's the anniversary next week,
actually,

505
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,360
because I was diagnosed two days
before my 18th birthday.

506
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,320
- Oh, were you?
- Yes.

507
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,240
- Oh, okay.
- [chuckles]

508
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,880
Up until then, I didn't have
any disability help whatsoever.

509
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,480
- You never got any help whatsoever?
- No.

510
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,160
I almost had to repeat, even with support,
so that's amazing.

511
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,880
I do have social difficulties.

512
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Problem is...

513
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,320
they overlooked my symptoms,
because, as a child,

514
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,080
none of my symptoms
were out of place for a child that age.

515
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,280
Oh, really?

516
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,120
Because it presents differently in girls,
and there's no criteria for girls.

517
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,240
- Oh, that's a bit silly.
- [Olivia] Yeah, I know.

518
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,840
Which is why I got... [burps]

519
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,160
Whoa, sorry. [laughs]

520
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,120
Overlooked.

521
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,440
It is. [laughs]

522
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,400
[laughing]

523
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,560
[laughs]

524
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
[Jackson] But you're right, now.

525
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,016
You're having some trouble here and there,
and I have some trouble time to time, too,

526
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,280
but, you know,
uh, I think you're very lovely,

527
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,440
and, uh, I don't think there's anything
really that wrong with you.

528
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,800
[Olivia chuckles] Aww.

529
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
[Jackson chuckles]

530
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,320
Uh, I've organized a pottery class.

531
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,480
- Would you like to go do that with me?
- Yeah, sure.

532
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360
- Really?
- Yeah.

533
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,720
All right. Well, good. Let's go!

534
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,376
[Jackson] I think she's very sweet
and she's very cute too.

535
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,520
I like that she can laugh at anything.

536
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,480
That's very nice.

537
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,640
You still a bit cold?

538
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,640
Yeah, but nothing you can do about it.
[chuckles]

539
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,720
Would you like my jacket?

540
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,440
- You sure?
- Yeah, have my jacket.

541
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
[Olivia] Thank you.

542
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,320
She's also got pretty red hair.
I can be a bit of a sucker for redheads.

543
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,120
[Jackson] Do you want me
to make something for you or something?

544
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,320
Maybe I can make a controller for you,
since you're so into games.

545
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,960
[laughs] Maybe.

546
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
All right.

547
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,440
We're going all <i>Ghost</i> on this date,
with pottery.

548
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
[both chuckle]

549
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,920
I can't imagine
how they would've done that scene.

550
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,280
Uh, well, probably would have to do
a lot of retakes.

551
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
[Olivia laughs]

552
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,200
- It's a bit creepy, because he's a ghost.
- Yeah.

553
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,120
A bit touchy-feely.

554
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,240
Maybe I would do something like that,
but not on camera, I think.

555
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,560
[both laugh]

556
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,800
That's something couples do in private,
I think.

557
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,600
- Yeah.
- [both laugh]

558
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,160
[Jackson] There you go.
PlayStation controller.

559
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,320
Yay!

560
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
[Olivia laughs]

561
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,800
[Olivia] Thank you.

562
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,160
I really enjoyed the day,
and I enjoyed your company.

563
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,440
I just really want
to get to know you more.

564
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,640
- You know?
- Same.

565
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,360
Would you like to do this again?

566
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,320
Yeah, sure!

567
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,520
Can I get your number?

568
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Sure, um...

569
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Um...

570
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,040
- Here.
- [laughs]

571
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Put the game on pause.

572
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,080
- Uh... [laughs]
- [Jackson chuckles]

573
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,880
[phone chimes]

574
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,800
- Okay. Save... Olivia.
- [phone chimes]

575
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,120
Mine can take a picture,
so I'll take a picture of you.

576
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
All right.

577
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,840
[camera shutter clicks]

578
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,240
So, um, maybe we'll do this again
some other time, yeah?

579
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
Yeah, I'd love to.

580
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
All right.

581
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Yeah.

582
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,760
- Let's go.
- [Olivia] Let's go.

583
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,600
[Cian] What do you guys dream about
for your future together?

584
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,640
Well, we wanna get married one day,
but first, we're gonna travel.

585
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,400
I wanna just do all of the things

586
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,120
that Sharnae never thought
she would be able to do.

587
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,320
Breathe in the Gold Coast air.

588
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,120
[excited laughter]

589
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,440
[narrator] <i>Jimmy and Sharnae</i>
<i>are arriving at the Gold Coast</i>

590
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,640
<i>for their first-ever holiday together.</i>

591
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,720
<i>And Jimmy has a surprise in store
for tomorrow.</i>

592
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,360
- [Sharnae] Hey, you!
- Hello.

593
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
What are you doing?

594
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,640
[Cian] What have you got planned
for your holiday?

595
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,680
- [Jimmy gasps] We're going to theme parks.
- [squeals] Going on the rides!

596
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,200
We're also going
to a romantic dinner together.

597
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,736
- [Jimmy] Ooh!
- Ooh! [excited humming]

598
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,520
Yeah, we don't usually go
on romantic dates,

599
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,720
because that means
you have to go to restaurants,

600
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,016
and that means you have to go
to places where people are.

601
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,920
We have dinner at our house,
that's romantic.

602
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,160
- Ooh.
- [Sharnae] Ooh.

603
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,016
- [Sharnae] Here to check in.
- Lovely. Yes.

604
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,560
Just a photo ID for check-in.

605
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,000
- There you go.
- [woman] Thank you.

606
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,960
So just reconfirming,

607
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,800
you've booked a one-bedroom
ocean spa apartment for three nights.

608
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
- Yeah!
- Fancy.

609
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,440
This is the rules.
It just says don't lose the keys...

610
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,680
- Yeah, we don't do that. We follow rules.
- Perfect.

611
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,040
- So, just both names and signatures.
- We love rules. [chuckles]

612
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,880
1342, right there.

613
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,800
- [Sharnae] Right there.
- Ooh.

614
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,760
[Sharnae chuckles]

615
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,200
[laughing] And we're here.

616
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,120
Oh, my God.

617
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,880
- Whoa, this is pretty cool!
- [laughing] Look at it.

618
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
[both] It's got strawberries!

619
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,200
[Sharnae] There's flowers.

620
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,560
- Oh, chocolates!
- Ooh, fancy.

621
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,520
- Are they chocolates or soap?
- No, chocolate.

622
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,720
[Jimmy] Oh, cool.

623
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,600
These spoons
are the wrong way around, though.

624
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,680
- [Sharnae] Holy shit! We got a bath!
- [Jimmy] Oh, look at the bath!

625
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,120
[both laughing]

626
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,440

- [laughing]

627
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,720
- Look at that!
- [laughing]

628
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,080
[Sharnae] Oh, my...

629
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,000
- [Jimmy] God!
- [Sharnae] ...God!

630
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,320
- That's so cool.
- Holy shit!

631
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
- [Jimmy laughing]
- Whoo!

632
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,880
Wanna go out on the veranda?

633
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,920
- It's raining. Here we go.
- It's gonna be scary.

634
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,760
I can't open it. [grunts]

635
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,160
- I'm so weak.
- [laughs]

636
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,600
- That way.
- Together. Go.

637
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,800
[Jimmy laughs] We're gonna break it.

638
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,816
- [Sharnae] There's a technique.
- What do you do?

639
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,320
[Sharnae] I don't know! No...

640
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,040
You would think,
with our beautiful minds,

641
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,840
we'd be able to open a freaking door.

642
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,080
Wait, this one might open. Nah, key.

643
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,520
[Jimmy] We don't have a key,
but we can go out here. Oh, my Lord!

644
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,616
- [laughing] You can access the roof.
- [Sharnae] Aah!

645
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh, my God!

646
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,160
We could die.

647
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,840
Shh! Don't touch it!

648
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,520
Oh, look at the ocean view!

649
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,600
- Isn't it beautiful at nighttime?
- [Jimmy] Isn't it just?

650
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
[Sharnae] Wee!

651
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,560
- It's nice and comfy.
- Yeah.

652
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,080
- [Sharnae] Aah! Aah.
- [Jimmy] Mmm.

653

Yeah.

660
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,280
Uh-oh! They could've died.

661
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,200
Yeah, man.

662
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,440
Gotta wait for the green light.
Rules are rules.

663
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,600
- I'm gonna go on this. Wee!
- Go this way.

664
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Nae!

665
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,920
- [Sharnae] That was fun.
- [Jimmy] You're crazy.

666
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,576
[Jimmy] By the way, have you noticed
we actually hold hands

667
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,880
for longer than five seconds of duration?

668
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,720
- [Cian] True!
<i>- </i>Yes, we are. So sweaty.

669
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,440
- [Cian] When did that change?
- Um...

670
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,456
- I don't know.
- Jimmy's getting used to it more.

671
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,360
- [Cian] Is that a holiday rule?
- Yeah, no.

672
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,640
No, I think I just wanna be...

673
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,960
- as close to Sharnae at all times...
- Yeah.

674
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,320
- 'cause she is my friend.
- I love it. I love you.

675
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,960
- Yuck!
- Can I kiss you?

676
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,440
- No!
- Why?

677
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,400
We're still on camera.

678
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,200
[Sharnae] I don't care about the cameras.
It's just me and you.

are going on a romantic dinner. [giggles]

689

So exciting.

690
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,840
I'm getting all ready for it.
This outfit I got from the shops.

691
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,800
It looks like a dress, but it's pants.

Dress... pants.

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,520
Gonna put your jacket on?

[Sharnae] Hmm.

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,360
I need navy socks.

704
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,840

- Should've got navy socks.

[inhales through teeth]

707
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,720
[Jimmy] Navy socks.
When you get a navy suit, get navy socks.

708
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
[Sharnae] Yeah.

709
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,600
Brown shoes go with navy suits,
not black shoes.

710
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,680
But black socks definitely don't go
with navy suits.

711
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
- No.
- [Jimmy] I need navy socks.

- [Jimmy] Is there a store around here...

Maybe tomorrow.

714
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
It's too late.

715
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,600
- Get my bag.
- Look, 'cause if I go like this...

716
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,496
- [Sharnae] Yep, we know.
- [Jimmy] Like that...

717
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,240
- Black socks don't go with...
- [Sharnae] Yep. We'll get navy socks.

[Jimmy, to himself] Idiot.

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,680
[Sharnae] Got your cube?
Can you get them ones, please?

720
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Ready to go now?

What do we do now?

727
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,040
Get navy socks.

728
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,280
Yeah, we'll go get navy socks now.
Come on.

729
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,160
[Jimmy] All right, bye.
I'm going to buy navy socks.

732
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,960
[Cian] Have any rules for dating?

733
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,880
Be polite, on time,

734
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,040
wear, uh, nice clothes,

735
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,160
uh, good hygiene as well.

736
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,440
Uh, never, uh, use your mobile phone,

737
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,280

Uh, nice try.

I had someone, uh, before,

793
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,360
and, yeah, went on a date night...

794
