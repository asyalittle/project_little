1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,382
I'm Vanessa Lachey.

2
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,634
I'm obviously Nick Lachey, her husband.

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,636
Welcome to the blind love experiment.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,596
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,640
Here, you will choose someone to marry

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,058
without ever seeing them.

7
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,102
Amber, will you marry me?

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,021
- Yes.
- Whoo!

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,357
Once you're engaged,

10
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:28,945
you'll finally get to see your fiancÃ©
for the very first time.

11
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,449
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,750
And you're going to attempt
to grow your emotional connection

13
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,455
into a physical one.

14
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,956
Motherfucker.

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,792
Listen for two seconds.

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,002
I have been listening.

17
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,129
Dude, if I'm 24, I don't want
to be having kids.

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,173
Again, I'm not your average 24-year-old.

19
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,259
You're like the first white guy
I've dated.

20
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,345
And in just four weeks,
you'll be at your wedding.

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,932
Will you say "I do" to the person
you chose, sight unseen?

22
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,142
Of course I do.

23
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,480
Or are you going to walk away
from them forever?

24
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,324
Damian Powers,

25
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,949
do you take

26
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,871
Giannina Milady Gibelli

27
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,499
to be your lawful wedded wife,

28
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,628
to live together in the holy estate
of matrimony?

29
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,128
Will you love her,

30
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,922
comfort her,

31
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:34,761
honor and keep her,
so long as you both shall live?

32
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,438
I do not.

33
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,173
Okay.

34
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,593
- Giannina...
- Okay.

35
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,306
- Okay.
- I do love you.

36
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,390
Okay.

37
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,476
- Since day one, I...
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,475
I've wanted this.
I've wanted to marry you.

39
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,189
I have... I've stayed consistent

40
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,066
- all the way through this.
- Okay.

41
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,985
And...

42
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,865
- Okay.
- You have not.

43
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,870
- I can't handle the ups and downs...
- I understand.

44
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,830
of you loving me one day,

45
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,791
and saying you want to be friends
the next.

46
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,292
I did not.

47
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,171
It would be selfish of me
to marry you today,

48
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,131
knowing as much

49
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,751
as you tell me you're ready,

50
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,301
I see that you're not.

51
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,640
Just get me out of here.

52
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,817
Giannina...

53
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,279
How dare you?

54
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,907
Get out of my face.

55
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,161
G...

56
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,662
Giannina.

57
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,139
Please, please, leave me alone.

58
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,462
Leave me the fuck alone.

59
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,449
I'm out of here.

60
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,285
Get me out of here.

61
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,535
I'm done.

62
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,165
Giannina!

63
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,785
- Everything is shit.
- Uh-huh.

64
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,371
Ideally, you would have said no

65
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,580
and he would have said yes.

66
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,917
Not the reverse,
because this way it hurts more.

67
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,005
I know.

68
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,550
This shouldn't happen. Who does that?

69
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,677
You should have said no, no?

70
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,929
You should have said no, too.

71
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,141
Don't cry. I'm okay.

72
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,349
I'm okay.

73
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,397
You almost fainted there.

74
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,232
I almost died.

75
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,151
Buddy.

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Stand up.

77
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,407
You all right, man?

78
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,575
What happened, buddy?

79
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,161
- She ran.
- She ran?

80
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,754
- That is the hardest thing I've ever done.
- I know. I could tell.

81
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,216
I wanted to say yes. I wanted to.

82
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,552
Even though she was all-in today,
it was...

83
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,635
It was one...

84
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,475
It's one day she's been all-in,
through everything we've been through.

85
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,643
And I respect it, I love that.

86
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,103
Like, it made me...

87
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,773
I wasn't sure if she was going to say yes.

88
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,732
And when she did,

89
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,569
it melted my heart and broke it
at the same time because...

90
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,780
in that moment,
I was like, "This isn't right,"

91
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,156
because she's saying yes,

92
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,319
but everything she showed me,
her actions, her words,

93
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,411
everything otherwise
said that she is not ready for marriage

94
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,580
I feel like I just broke her heart.

95
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,504
It sucks.

96
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,136
But I need somebody that's all-in...

97
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,347
every day.

98
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,431
Not just some.

99
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,056
- I need to talk to him.
<i>- Ay, Giannina.</i>

100
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,228
Yes.

101
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,313
My heart...

102
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,733
is literally in a million pieces.

103
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,317
I was hurt.

104
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,528
Hurt.

105
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,325
I want to punch him in the face.

106
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,120
But right now, I'm going to figure out

107
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,414
why this happened to me.

108
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,764
I'm so sorry.

109
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,392
You couldn't have told me?

110
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,184
Like, for real?

111
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,811
I didn't know.

112
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,021
You didn't know?

113
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,566
- You didn't know?
- I almost said "I do."

114
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,691
Okay.

115
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,531
What the fuck happened?

116
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,533
What happened?

117
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,993
Please, sit down.

118
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,495
Let's talk.

119
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,708
Apparently,

120
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,961
that's the one thing that we can't do.

121
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,088
So right now, we are going to talk.

122
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,172
Please sit.

123
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,394
In that moment, it was... beautiful.

124
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,937
Everything you said was perfect.

125
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,939
Everything felt so right.

126
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,902
But that's one moment for the rest
of my life.

127
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,028
For the rest of our lives.

128
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,364
That's such a beautiful excuse, darling.

129
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,950
Because what you said up there
was bullshit.

130
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,079
- How dare you?
- I'm sorry you took it like that.

131
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,457
I... Um, you're sorry I took it like that.

132
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,916
Listen,

133
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,293
Damian,

134
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,376
seriously.

135
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,172
I didn't want to get my heart broken,

136
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,757
so I pushed you away.

137
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,717
Great. You kept coming back to me.

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,052
Why did you keep coming back

139
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,679
even though I was putting you down
What's wrong with you?

140
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,349
So why is it that all of this
is blamed on me?

141
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,368
This is the problem.
You're making it about you.

142
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,311
It's both of us that went through this.

143
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,688
You literally blamed it all on me.

144
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,359
I always treated you with kindness,

145
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,278
even when I was in adversity,
even when I was uncertain

146
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,905
and I didn't know what I wanted.

147
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,031
This is what you do.

148
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,033
- What?
- This is what you do.

149
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,118
- What?
- You don't realize

150
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,996
what you say and how you say it.

151
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,624
- And you know what?
- Get out of my face, please.

152
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,708
I'm not in your face, G.

153
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,918
But what I'm telling you is

154
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,213
- you did that to me and you said yes.
- You blamed everything on me,

155
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,881
and all I did was tell you how I felt,

156
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,725
and I wanted to work
everything out with you.

157
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,177
- G...
- I wanted to work it out so bad.

158
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,804
- This is you running...
- So bad!

159
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,348
...and I'm trying to talk to you
right now.

160
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,517
What I am asking you is not to run.

161
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,143
I love you.

162
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,605
I'm in love with you,
and I always will be.

163
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,696
And I know what happened today
was embarrassing

164
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,193
and you'll never forgive me for it.

165
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,277
And I'm sorry.

166
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,948
You messed up.

167
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,032
Honestly...

168
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,789
that was such bullshit.

169
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,211
You can take your bow back.

170
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,060
I told the woman I loved
"I do not" at the altar.

171
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,980
And I broke both of our hearts
in that moment.

172
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,817
But if you ask me, "Is love blind,"
the answer is simple.

173
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,110
Love is blind.

174
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,405
No matter where we end up or where we go,

175
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,490
this was mine and Giannina's love story.

176
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,659
This is how it goes.

177
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,494
I can't say it's over.

178
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,872
We may need time apart.

179
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,433
But it doesn't mean we won't be part
of each other's lives again.

180
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,502
I would like to think so, anyways.

181
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,904
The morning
of my wedding is a disaster.

182
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,032
My fiancÃ© is having cold feet.

183
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,242
I got a text from Barnett.

184
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,536
He's... He's freaking out.

185
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,082
Which obviously doesn't put me at ease.

186
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,672
And I asked, "What's on your mind?

187
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,757
What's wrong? Are you getting cold feet?"

188
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,092
And he said, "Yeah."

189
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,095
So I tried to call him.

190
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,597
And he didn't answer.

191
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,309
So I tried to call him again,
he didn't answer.

192
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,774
It's not exactly, uh...

193
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,442
reassuring.

194
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,118
I don't know what else I can do.

195
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,998
<i>âª Strings all choked with rust âª</i>

196
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,585
<i>âª Can't play that sweet song anymore âª</i>

197
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,214
<i>âª Haunted by a memory âª</i>

198
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,179
Today is my wedding day,
and I'm...

199
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,851
I'm kind of having a little bit of a...
a freak-out.

200
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,353
I woke up this morning

201
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,648
with this giant pit in my stomach,
basically, and it was like...

202
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,194
my whole life before this point flashed
before my eyes.

203
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,115
I took a shower and I started tearing up
in the shower just because it was so much.

204
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,617
But I built that emotional connection
with Amber.

205
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,619
I did fall in love with her in the pods,

206
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,913
but if I'm going to spend the rest
of my life

207
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,498
with this person, I want to make sure

208
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,500
that it's going to be someone

209
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,961
that I am going to be happy with forever.

210
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,423
- You have makeup credit card debt?
- I do.

211
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,925
Oh, and there's my student debt

212
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,845
from where I never graduated college.

213
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,639
I don't want you to be

214
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,476
jumping into something because of...

215
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,227
how you guys met.

216
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,022
Are you willing to give up everything
for this person?

217
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,149
Everything?

218
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,569
So, what if there is an issue

219
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,238
between me and somebody in your family?

220
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,782
Can you manage that?

221
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,408
Can you stand up to them?

222
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,535
Whose side are you going to be on?

223
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,786
I don't know.

224
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,792
It's the biggest decision of my life.

225
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,377
I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet.

226
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,005
But it's so freaking difficult.

227
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,882
Oh God-dang it.

228
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,382
Aww.

229
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,013
<i>âª Try to get back on my feet
But every single time I do âª</i>

230
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,474
<i>âª I can't get my heart to be straight âª</i>

231
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,768
<i>âª 'Cause my heart has been removed âª</i>

232
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,437
<i>âª How can I put me back together âª</i>

233
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,940
<i>âª How can I fix this open wound âª</i>

234
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,484
Oh, my gosh.

235
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,735
Wow.

236
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,822
Are you excited, you nervous? What?

237
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,991
All of the above.

238
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,507
Barnett's freaking out about the wedding,

239
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,497
and instead of talking to me he clams up,
and that's hard.

240
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,304
And normally it's something that I can...

241
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,042
I know that I have to deal with,

242
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,794
because that's who he is.

243
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,877
He's not...

244
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,714
- An open person.
- He's not a huge talker about it.

245
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,438
He doesn't talk about his feelings a lot.

246
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,676
And that's something that,

247
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,469
even when we started dating in the pods,

248
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,972
that was something I was,
working on really hard.

249
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,391
So what made him be the one,
Amber?

250
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,978
I felt like the very first time
we ever talked,

251
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,731
I felt like he could be my best friend.

252
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,611
Magical things happen
on wedding days, you know.

253
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,822
I need all the magic today.

254
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,619
- I love you.
- I know.

255
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,165
I love Barnett an indescribable amount,

256
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,418
and I'm just ready.

257
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:42,673
I just want to be living day-to-day life.

258
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,718
Like, I'm ready to have my best friend

259
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,887
that I can share my life with.

260
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,682
I knew from the get-go,

261
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,642
from our very first meeting.

262
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,936
Do you want kids, Barnett?

263
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,063
- Do I have kids?
- Wait, do you have kids?

264
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,987
- That's a question, too.
- Not that I know of.

265
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,442
No, I'm kidding.

266
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,319
My favorite was Barnett.

267
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,821
He made me laugh so much.

268
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,366
- Hi.
- Hello.

269
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,659
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, God.

270
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,828
Oh, my God.

271
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,039
- Wow.
- Hi.

272
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,542
- Holy shit. Hello.
- Hi.

273
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,709
Hi.

274
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,966
We're just a little bit different.

275
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,468
Different enough that it works.

276
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,472
You complete me.

277
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,185
With everything that we have...

278
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,604
been through already,

279
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,982
I guess I'd say my

280
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,568
biggest fear about this is

281
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,780
that I get down the aisle and...

282
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,283
Matt still isn't sure.

283
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,245
All right.

284
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,748
Oh, my gosh.

285
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,084
- Ready?
- Uh, no.

286
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,127
Getting there? Yeah, me neither.

287
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,255
I love you.

288
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,302
- Stop crying.
- You're my baby, Amber.

289
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,386
Mom.

290
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,643
I'm sorry. I love you so much.

291
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,144
Don't cry.

292
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,187
Mm.

293
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,067
Well, let's get you married, my girl.

294
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,859
Oof.

295
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,150
They should be here.

296
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,694
We've been sitting here
for an hour and a half.

297
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,321
Oh, Lord.

298
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,450
- Ready?
- Yes.

299
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,327
Oh, gosh.

300
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,068
This is a commitment.

301
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,902
This is the big moment of your life.

302
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,709
- I love you.
- Love you, Mom.

303
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,215
Ladies and gentlemen, the groom

304
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,259
and his beautiful mother.

305
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,433
- Slow down.
- Slow down.

306
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,727
Geez.

307
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,489
I'm not crying.

308
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,709
It's hot in here.

309
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,299
Oh, gosh.

310
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109
My little girl, all grown up.

311
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,194
Now remember, no matter what,

312
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,490
something worth having
is something worth fighting for.

313
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,991
- I know.
- And you never give up.

314
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,285
I've been fighting for this since day one.

315
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,150
The moment has arrived.

316
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,503
Would you please stand
in honor of the bride?

317
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Okay?

318
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
I guess.

319
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,449
You're not supposed to have
to fight for it all the time.

320
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,516
I told you that, too.

321
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,809
Make up your mind, woman.

322
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,745
It is supposed to be there naturally,
Amber Lynn.

323
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,038
- It was there naturally.
- Okay.

324
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,064
Would you make up your mind
what you want me to do?

325
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,868
You said if it's worth having,
fight for it.

326
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,318
You said you shouldn't have
to fight for it. I did both.

327
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,279
I found both.

328
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,739
It was there naturally,
and I did have to fight for it.

329
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,368
Well, I wish you luck.

330
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,950
Thank you.

331
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,132
Please be seated.

332
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,928
Who presents this bride to be wed?

333
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,429
- I do.
- Thank you.

334
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:27,351
Amber and Matthew,
you chose to get engaged

335
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,354
and spend the rest of your life together

336
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:35,067
based on
an incredible emotional connection.

337
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,948
You fell in love with who each of you are
on the inside,

338
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,742
and you decided to get married

339
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,078
before ever seeing one another.

340
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,083
Amber, if you will please
share your thoughts.

341
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,171
Never...

342
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,758
have I ever in my life

343
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,343
met a man

344
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,763
that irks my nerves like you do.

345
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,396
I found my love of a lifetime.

346
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,648
That's all I got.

347
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,108
You're going to mess up my makeup.

348
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,364
I never thought
that this would ever happen.

349
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,158
I never came into this thinking
that I would find anyone like you.

350
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,577
You are amazing,

351
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,579
you're beautiful, inside and out.

352
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,497
So...

353
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,044
Amber and Matthew,

354
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,630
you stand together in the presence of God

355
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,883
to decide whether or not
to face life together

356
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,635
as husband and wife,

357
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,680
or walk away from each other

358
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,973
forever.

359
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,479
Now is the time
to decide if love is blind.

360
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,235
Amber, do you take Matthew to be your
lawfully wedded husband,

361
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,655
to live together
in the holy estate of matrimony?

362
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,784
Will you love him, comfort him,
honor and keep him,

363
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,287
as long as you both shall live?

364
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,256
The fact that,
even when you're making me crazy,

365
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,426
I still am so in love with you

366
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,887
I can't help myself.

367
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,477
I do. I will.

368
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,520
Absolutely.

369
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,443
All right.

370
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,568
Yes.

371
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,240
You have become so much more
than I expected.

372
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,494
And I'm excited

373
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,955
that you get to keep becoming more
with me.

374
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,879
Matthew,

375
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,716
do you take Amber to be your lawfully
wedded wife,

376
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,386
to live together
in the holy estate of matrimony?

377
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,055
Will you love her,

378
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,265
comfort her, honor and keep her,

379
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,976
as long as you both shall live?

380
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,576
<i>âª Hold me now âª</i>

381
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:37,582
<i>âª I'm slipping on candlelight âª</i>

382
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,876
<i>âª Hold me now âª</i>

383
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:44,673
<i>âª As we walk into the night âª</i>

384
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,221
Oh, I do. A hundred percent.

385
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,809
I can't...
I can't imagine a life without you.

386
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,310
Good, because you are stuck.

387
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,189
I now pronounce you married!

388
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,027
- Mm.
- Mm.

389
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,281
Uh-uh.

390
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,201
Whoo!

391
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,997
- I love you.
- I love you.

392
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,252
Whoo!

393
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,963
Ladies and gentlemen, the bride and groom!

394
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,518
- Love you.
- Love you.

395
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,524
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, guess what.

396
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,109
- What?
- You're my husband.

397
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,802
- I think you have my last name now, so...
- I, um... We're going to make that happen.

398
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,074
Amber Barnett.

399
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,613
Doesn't sound as good now.

400
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,739
- You know...
- I'm kidding!

401
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,786
Get out of here.

402
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,288
Get out of here.

403
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,455
Get out of here.

404
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,414
I could never have imagined

405
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,472
that this experiment was gonna
end this way for me.

406
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,852
It's unreal that Kelly
is going to be my wife.

407
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,855
Honestly, I had given up hope
and given up thinking about, like,

408
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,815
the idea of even being married,

409
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,739
just because
I couldn't find that right person.

410
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,303
I know that I need to be with you,

411
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,863
and you're exactly
the person that I've been looking for.

412
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,616
And I want to ask you, Kelly Marie...

413
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,743
will you marry me?

414
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,538
I will. Yes.

415
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,415
I love you today,
and that love will remain,

416
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,752
but I can't wait to learn to love you
even more.

417
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,920
I love you too.

418
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,674
- How you doing?
- Hi.

419
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,925
Oh, my God!

420
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,388
I'm a big, big believer in serendipity,

421
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,431
and this is one of those
serendipitous moments,

422
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,225
and everything is just so clear.

423
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,935
That's where I feel right now.

424
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,270
Just happiness.

425
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,021
- Heyo.
- Yo.

426
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,825
- What's up, man?
- What's going on?

427
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,233
- Bossman.
- Good to see you.

428
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,192
I love the 'stache.

429
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,569
Thank you, thank you.

430
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,486
- What's up?
- Good.

431
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,822
I fell in love with Kelly, sight unseen

432
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,865
because we were both honest
with each other.

433
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,909
I learned who she is, truly.

434
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,828
This is a big moment, wedding day.

435
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,280
A little... A little surreal.

436
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,999
That's an understatement of a lifetime.

437
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,208
Yeah.

438
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,836
She's genuine, she's ambitious,
she's passionate,

439
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,964
and she's the woman that I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

440
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,968
Fellas, you guys want to
check out the suits you'll be wearing?

441
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,012
- Let's do it.
- That I picked out for you guys?

442
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,228
Oh, this is so pretty.

443
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,150
We tend to fantasize
our fairy-tale weddings

444
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,235
and our fairy-tale Prince Charming,
you know.

445
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,820
- Hi.
- Hi.

446
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,156
- Yay!
- Yay!

447
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,034
- Oh, hi, honey.
- Oh, hi.

448
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,452
- You know...
- I love you.

449
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,038
I love Kenny. He's absolutely perfect.

450
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,580
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

451
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,961
But I am nervous because I don't know
if I am, like, 100% in love with him.

452
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,773
Did you learn a lot about yourself?

453
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,049
I did, yeah.

454
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,592
What did you learn?

455
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,719
I mean, I knew that I...

456
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,389
was capable of loving someone
for their personality, of course.

457
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,473
Um...

458
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,197
Would you have
talked to him if you saw him before?

459
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,937
No, I probably wouldn't have.

460
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,607
The love that I had for my ex-boyfriend...

461
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,942
I mean, my mom has said this for years.

462
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,487
She was like,
"You were infatuated with him."

463
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,616
I don't have that same crazy infatuation

464
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,327
for Kenny, as I did with this man.

465
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,772
We were able to make
this commitment to each other,

466
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,832
and then we haven't, you know,
had sex yet.

467
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,086
I know how I feel about it.

468
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,754
Like, how do you feel about it?

469
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,008
We are just so perfect on every level.

470
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,301
- Right.
- And I just, like,

471
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,512
don't want to throw that
in the mix just yet.

472
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,970
That's why I keep saying

473
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,265
I'm not in love with him,
because if I was in love,

474
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,934
I would have that infatuation, like...

475
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,019
nothing else matters.

476
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,604
But obviously I'm conflicted.

477
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,191
Maybe what my whole definition of what
"in love" is supposed to feel like

478
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,693
is not right.

479
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,277
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

480
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,361
You're welcome.

481
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,714
I know there's, like,

482
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,156
so much makeup on my face, but...

483
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,700
- You won't be able to tell.
- Yeah.

484
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,798
So, how are you feeling
about the wedding?

485
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,494
I mean, I'm...

486
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:31,459
you know, having the decision of,
if I say "I do," and if I don't.

487
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,543
Um...

488
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,588
and, like, what life would look like
in both of those extremes.

489
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,341
Um, so, me saying "I do,"

490
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,552
I know that everything would be great,

491
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,889
because our, our relationship is so solid.

492
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,727
If I say "I don't,"
it's simply because we're not...

493
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,853
It's not the right time.

494
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,314
So I've, like, weighed both scenarios out.

495
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,567
What are some of your cons?

496
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,403
If I were to say "I do,"
and something were to happen,

497
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,030
like, that's what the only, like,
fear that I have is that...

498
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,197
it doesn't work out.

499
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,369
So you still have a little hesitancy
going into it?

500
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,705
Yeah, and it's like another thing
I think of is

501
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,249
this engagement has been so short-lived,
it's like...

502
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,294
But are we still in the, like...
Are we just in a honeymoon phase?

503
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,963
I do believe that we are both

504
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,632
completely true to ourselves,
and we're being very real.

505
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:24,554
But even when you're real,
you have a honeymoon phase.

506
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,891
- Right.
- And is it just happy

507
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,684
and rainbows and butterflies right now

508
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,644
because we haven't known each other
that long,

509
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,897
and we haven't had a relationship
in a long time.

510
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,232
- Right.
- And it's just a beautiful thing

511
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,796
that we've connected with someone,
but in four months from now,

512
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,132
are we still gonna be in that same...

513
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,156
So it's the fear of the possibilities

514
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,616
- of it changing.
- Yeah.

515
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,911
I just have to believe myself
and listen to my heart.

516
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,747
I feel excited for her and Kenny
and everything going on,

517
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,207
and I feel nervous

518
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,376
for just how she feels.

519
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,128
I do think she wants Kenny,

520
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,256
but sometimes in life
you get an opportunity

521
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,884
and if you don't jump on it,

522
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,053
sometimes you miss the boat.

523
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,472
You know, I met Kenny briefly.

524
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,433
He was, like, very intelligent.
Confident, too.

525
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,768
- Funny...
- Mm-hmm.

526
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,813
and well-spoken,
and he seems very trustworthy.

527
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,650
He's been one of the better,
if not the best, so far,

528
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,735
of the men that you've brought in.

529
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
So,

530
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,324
you know, just maybe
when you're walking down the aisle,

531
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,285
when you're looking at him,
I'm sure, eye to eye...

532
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,871
- Yeah.
- ...that you recognize

533
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,833
what the beauty of the relationship is
with him

534
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,239
and then kind of go through all of that,
even in your mind

535
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,128
because I know you don't know,

536
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,548
and I don't know exactly what
your decision is gonna be

537
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,882
- on the altar.
- Right.

538
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,676
Because things can change
from now to then.

539
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,096
I want to see her smiling
and happy every day,

540
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,390
and this man, Kenny,

541
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,477
becoming her husband, her spouse,
and the man that she loves.

542
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,454
I just hope that when she gets to alter

543
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,774
she makes the decision
that's right for her heart in this moment

544
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,027
and knows that she is walking into
a very good relationship.

545
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,489
The risks, the great risks in life,
you got to take that jump.

546
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,074
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

547
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,867
Give me a hug.

548
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,870
I love you.

549
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,039
Y'all been drinking?

550
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,683
Yeah, we've been drinking a little bit.

551
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,513
- Come here, baby.
- I'm being responsible.

552
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,419
Oh...

553
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,921
How are you doing?

554
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:23,882
A little anxious.

555
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,125
- You anxious?
- A little bit.

556
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,459
So, how you doing?
Is this your little journal?

557
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,222
This is my journal, yeah.
Just writing some notes, thoughts.

558
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,099
- So what are you thinking?
- In the past...

559
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,182
Uh...

560
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,643
I'm just excited.

561
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,936
It's all positive things

562
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,480
because it's just that next step for me
and her to take

563
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,924
and continue our journey together.

564
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,193
The greatest advice I can give you

565
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,780
is to ask God to let you see your spouse

566
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,449
- through His eyes.
- Yeah.

567
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,036
It feels surreal to be
the mother of a groom

568
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,996
in a situation like this.

569
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,167
I love that Kenny is getting married,

570
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,878
and I'm excited

571
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,422
because family is the most important thing
to me,

572
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,508
and I can see Kelly
fitting into our family.

573
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,260
So that makes me very happy.

574
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,429
I'm so glad you're our son.

575
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,264
You're good, Mom.

576
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,434
My only son.

577
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,816
I just want you to find somebody
who loves you as much as I do.

578
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,069
She does and I'm so thankful for it.

579
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,779
That's what this has showed me.

580
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,050
- Well, you know it. Love you.
- I'm down here crying in basements.

581
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:31,950
- I know.
- Yeah.

582
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,409
I need some wine.

583
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,662
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, I can take your bag.

584
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,996
Thank you.

585
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,414
- Aww.
- You look pretty.

586
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,334
So do you. You look beautiful.

587
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,543
Thank you.

588
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,046
Today, I am the mother of the bride.

589
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,129
It's exciting.

590
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,339
It's very exciting.

591
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,509
- It looks real pretty.
- Thank you.

592
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,387
Thank you.

593
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,846
Don't mess up your makeup.

594
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,683
- It looks gorgeous.
- You do. I don't want to cry.

595
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,186
- It's okay, you can cry.
- No, because you look too pretty.

596
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,398
Don't cry.
You're going to make me cry.

597
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,278
- But you're happy? And excited?
- Yeah.

598
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,989
- Okay.
- I'm okay.

599
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,535
After I put my dress on and everything,
it feels surreal.

600
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,938
It does feel like that
fairy tale that every little girl...

601
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,955
imagined.

602
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,207
Aww. These are so pretty.

603
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,001
I love Kenny,

604
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,254
and getting married
to someone is a freaking big deal,

605
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,589
and it is going to be emotional.

606
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,926
I'm already preparing myself for that.

607
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,346
All right. Here we go.

608
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,347
Here we go.

609
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,946
<i>âª This time, this time âª</i>

610
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,950
<i>âª There's no turning back âª</i>

611
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,455
<i>âª Rise and fall âª</i>

612
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:05,084
<i>âª And shine or faint to black âª</i>

613
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,131
<i>âª We'll never give up
We'll never give in âª</i>

614
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,966
<i>âª It's now or never âª</i>

615
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,511
<i>âª Are you in âª</i>

616
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,346
<i>âª This time âª</i>

617
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,640
The last time I did this was 32 years ago.

618
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,642
- Walking down the aisle?
- With my dad.

619
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,895
It's uh... It is nerve-wracking.

620
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,647
His arm was vibrating the entire time.

621
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,733
- Am I vibrating?
- No, you're good.

622
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:29,817
- Yeah.
- You're good.

623
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,155
I still feel this same love
that I've had for Kelly this entire time.

624
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,491
She is exactly the woman
that I've been looking for.

625
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,577
I mean, I feel certain
about what I'm about to, you know, do.

626
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,497
So above anything else, I'm just excited.

627
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,290
- Love you.
- I love you.

628
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,670
Ready to walk?

629
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,754
Yes, I'm ready.

630
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,177
<i>âª This time, this time
There's no turning back âª</i>

631
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,638
<i>âª It's now or never âª</i>

632
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,224

634
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,353
- How's it going?
- Good.

635
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,605
Hey. How y'all doing?

636
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,024
I don't know if it's appropriate,
but I'm gonna talk to you all either way.

637
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,151
Nice to see you.

638
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,034
Yeah, nice to finally...
Nice to see you again.

639
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,433
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah.

640
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,162
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

641
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,624
Four glasses of champagne, I'm good.

642
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,926
Oh, dear.

643
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,628
Here it is...

644
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,005
the land of no return.

645
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,526
Kenny is extremely supportive,

646
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:39,095
and he's my best friend,
my confidant, my person.

647
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,265
Having a partner to love
for the rest of my life means...

648
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,641
everything,

649
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,059
and it's a very big commitment.

650
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,395
And I am definitely not taking it lightly.

651
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,480
So I'm just very anxious.

652
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,610
Um, just want to let you know
how proud I am of you.

653
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,654
- Thank you.
- I really am.

654
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,822
I know, I know.

655
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,658
- I love you.
- I love you.

656
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
will you please rise for the bride?

657
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,012
<i>âª One night
Changed my life forever âª</i>

658
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,935
<i>Kelly's absolutely gorgeous.</i>

659
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,142
<i>She's even more beautiful
than I could have ever imagined</i>

660
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,227
<i>and I am immensely happy.</i>

661
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,147
<i>It was like, holy smokes,
like, this is me and her.</i>

662
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,735
<i>âª Moonlight, surrounded by the city âª</i>

663
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,944
Thank you, man.

664
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,988
<i>âª We fell in love, right there âª</i>

665
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,991
<i>âª Do you remember? âª</i>

666
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,951
<i>âª 'Cause I remember âª</i>

667
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,079
<i>âª You still take my breath away âª</i>

668
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,374
You may be seated.

669
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,925
Family and friends,
we are gathered here today

670
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,134
for something amazing:

671
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,928
holy matrimony.

672
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,511
Marriage.

673
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,973
Love is unpredictable,

674
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,559
especially in these circumstances.

675
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:12,897
The both of you fell in love
and got engaged sight still unseen.

676
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,068
It was all based on
just your deep connection,

677
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,612
your emotional connection
that you guys made.

678
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,323
It became clear in a short amount of time

679
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,343
that Kenneth and Kelly found exactly
what they were looking for.

680
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,247
<i>âª We fell in love, right there âª</i>

681
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,082
<i>âª Do you remember? âª</i>

682
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,168
You know, not only did we meet

683
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,213
um, by complete happenstance

684
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,715
and to have thought that going
into this experiment

685
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,718
that we would be here right now
is unbelievable

686
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,222
and I know that everyone that is here, uh,

687
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,393
for the most part,
are blind supporters of you,

688
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,770
and I want you to understand that.

689
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,939
You know, we haven't had an opportunity

690
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,862
to talk to the majority of people
in this room,

691
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,734
or for them to meet you,

692
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,779
and for them to meet me,
and it doesn't matter, right?

693
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,864
Because we know
what we've experienced.

694
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,034
I have nothing but love for your family,
that we have their support,

695
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,870
and they're here for us, thick and thin,

696
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,123
and the only thing that also matters

697
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,874
is that I will always be here for you.

698
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,043
No matter what.

699
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,172
And I can't wait to be a continued part
of your life.

700
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm going to cry.

701
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,053
This experiment,

702
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,013
um...

703
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,183
I mean, it brought me to you,

704
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,102
someone who is

705
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,523
so fabulous in every single aspect.

706
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,607
You know, and,

707
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,944
and this has been a wild ride,

708
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,655
and I am grateful that it has...

709
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,451
been with you because you've been
nothing but supportive,

710
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,413
and I appreciate every single moment
that I shared with you.

711
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,206
And I love you.

712
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:55,915
I know.

713
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,379
Now is the time to decide
if love is blind.

714
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,215
Together in the presence
of friends and family,

715
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,760
we will discover if you will walk
together in life

716
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,636
as husband and wife,

717
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,097
or walk away from each other forever.

718
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,392
Kelly, do you take Kenneth

719
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,270
to be your lawful wedded husband,

720
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,523
to live together
in the holy estate of matrimony?

721
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,068
Will you love him, comfort him,

722
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,153
honor and keep him,

723
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,238
in sickness and in health,

724
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,283
forsaking all others,
committed only to him,

725
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,659
so long as you both shall live?

726
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,541
I absolutely adore you

727
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,542
and love you.

728
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,214
I love you.

729
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,390
But I don't.

730
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,356
I can't marry you.

731
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,232
Um...

732
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,027
and I hope that you can appreciate that

733
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,154
and respect that decision of mine.

734
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,867
Thank you.

735
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:33,305
Obviously, this is just a whirlwind
for everyone,

736
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:37,768
and again, don't want to dive too deep
into it, and delve...

737
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,312
Because you take something
that is so complex,

738
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,065
and it is authentic, and it is real,

739
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,025
but today is not our day.

740
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,028
Um, but I love each
and every one of y'all,

741
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,490
and it's something that I'll cherish
and be grateful for forever.

742
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,867
God, I love this guy.

743
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,328
Yeah.

744
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:02,543
I know that wasn't easy
for you, vand mom and dad especially.

745
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:03,919
It's okay.

746
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,088
I had to be the one
to say "I don't."

747
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,381
That's not easy. I'm 33.

748
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,425
I should know
what the fuck I want right now.

749
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,469
Excuse my language,
but I should know what I want.

750
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,180
And I... And he's checking off every box,

751
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,891
but my love...
My, my feelings for him

752
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,144
were not as intense

753
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,646
as his apparently are for me.

754
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,149
So, I really do love you.

755
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,318
- And I appreciate you being here.
- I love you, too.

756
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,401
Yeah, me too.

757
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,538
<i>âª Some days it's hard âª</i>

758
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,582
<i>âª To see âª</i>

759
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,169
<i>âª If I was a fool âª</i>

760
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,052
You still wanna marry her
in the future?

761
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,687
I really can't answer that question now.

762
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,714
And it's completely...

763
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,635
You have to respect the fact
that I'm telling you this.

764
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,262
I don't know,
and please stop recording this,

765
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,346
because it's not...

766
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,973
It's... That's wrong.

767
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,017
- What?
- What you're asking me.

768
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,186
How you feel about Kelly?

769
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,076
This is not about how I feel about Kelly.

770
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,606
I'm not going to have things filmed.

771
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,982
Please stop recording, Jimmy.

772
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,943
We're not getting married.

773
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,186
I don't know if we're going
to maintain a relationship,

774
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,489
and, quite honestly,
it doesn't matter either way.

775
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,033
But I'm not going to speak to that.

776
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,870
So you don't know
if you're going to stay with her?

777
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,621
It doesn't matter.

778
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,873
I'm not answering that.

779
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,502
Just... it's very upsetting.

780
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:31,799
<i>âª It all fell down
It all fell down âª</i>

783
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,213
It's my wedding day
and I couldn't be happier.

784
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,133
Six weeks ago, I was looking for

785
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,719
the can't-eat, can't-sleep,
over-the-fence,

786
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,721
World Series-type of love,

787
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,306
and I have it.

788
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,309
I found full-blown love

789
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,352
like I've never experienced before.

790
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,229
You know, having Mark by my side,

791
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,690
who is such an amazing
incredible person...

792
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,442
He's changed me for the better

793
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,777
and that is why you marry someone.

794
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,863
<i>âª My eyes open wide âª</i>

795
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,201

<i>âª Gonna tear down the wall âª</i>

797
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,373
It's my wedding day.

798
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,833
Wow.

799
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,126
It's kind of... to say that.

800
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,254
I was so sure from the first time
I heard Jess' voice,

801
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,672
I knew that she was the one.

802
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,800
And, honestly, to have that kind of
emotional connection with someone

803
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,260
without ever even seeing them

804
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,640
is the most amazing thing
that's ever happened to me.

805
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,600
I feel like I made the right decision.

806
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,603
I couldn't imagine going through this
with anybody else.

807
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,195
How's the bump?

808
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,946
So good. I like it.

809
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,281
I like it a lot. It's perfect.

810
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,617
It's not too much, but it's just enough.
Yeah.

811
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,285
- You like it?
- Yeah, I like that.

812
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,371
In just a few hours from now,

813
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,290
we'll be walking down the aisle,
exchanging vows,

814
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,584
and I'm just ready.

815
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,086
I'm more ready than ever.

816
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:36,090
I couldn't have asked
to be in this with anyone else.

817
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,926
Jessica, you have my heart
and there's nobody in this world

818
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,009
that I would rather spend
the rest of my life with.

819
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,346
Will you marry me?

820
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,516
Yes.

821
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,272
- Of course I will.
- I want to kiss you. I want to hug you.

822
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,149
- I love you.
- Oh, God.

823
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,537
Today, has been, like,
the most important day, I think,

824
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,582
throughout this entire thing
because I just feel you.

825
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,793
- We're finally being ourselves.
- Yeah.

826
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,132
I'm definitely on the same page.

827
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,552
You know, I felt much more closer to you
right now than I have.

828
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,681
You embody everything
that I've ever wanted,

829
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,433
and I realized that tonight.

830
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,851
I love you, babe.

831
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,518
Loves ya.

832
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,904
- Whoa!
- What up?

833
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,740
- What's up?
- What up?

834
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,575
What's up, dude?

835
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:49,079
My guys being here in support of
my relationship with Jess...

836
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,724
- What's up, dude?
- What's up, bro?

837
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,891
That to me means the world

838
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,125
because I think, at first,

839
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,918
we're worried about
what they're gonna say,

840
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,588
but when they support you, it's just...
I couldn't be happier.

841
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,839
Salud.

842
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,632
Cheers! I'm glad you guys are here.

843
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,717
Seriously.

844
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,636
- Hello.
- Hey.

845
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,531
- Look at you, pretty girl.
- Hi, beautiful.

846
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,195
- You look so good!
- And gorge.

847
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,808
You guys look so pretty.

848
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,978
You look beautiful. You look perfect.

849
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,897
I feel like a bride today.

850
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,693
Obviously, I've got the dress,
and I feel all those little butterflies.

851
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,195
Oh!

852
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,278
All right.

853
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,740
I think I've got
a really good support system

854
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,116
and I'm feeling great.

855
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,536
I know that you've been hopeful
that this is all going to work out

856
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,663
and I actually admire that about you

857
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,874
because I'm the type of person
that's, like,

858
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,043
if I don't know for sure
something's going to happen,

859
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,337
I shut it down and I keep myself out of it

860
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,463
so I don't get hurt.

861
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,882
So what are you hoping
is going to happen today?

862
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,884
You know, for me, what I hope...

863
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,428
I'll start off with that.
What I hope happens today is

864
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,554
we say "I do."

865
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,850
If she says "yes," I know I can be
the man I need to be.

866
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,310
She says "no,"

867
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,520
it's going to hurt.

868
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,438
It's going to be...
it's going to be painful,

869
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,815
but I know where I stand,

870
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,944
and no matter what has had happened,
the ups, the downs, the hot, the cold,

871
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,821
when I see her, it's still the same.

872
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:04,738
She's my person.

873
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,114
How are you?

874
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,518
- Um...
- Are you excited?

875
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,534
I'm excited.

876
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,952
Mm-hmm.

877
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,372
I'm nervous too, but I'm excited.

878
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,455
Mm-hmm.

879
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,377
Mark is everything
I've ever wanted.

880
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,462
I definitely, wholeheartedly,

881
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,756
fell in love more so than I've ever been,

882
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,592
but the person I fell in love with
in the pod,

883
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,927
where it was so insulated

884
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,179
and you were just having
an emotional conversation

885
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,472
and an emotional connection,

886
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,767
was a totally different experience
in the real world.

887
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,269
I'm someone who wants kids.

888
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,313
Dude, if I'm 24, I don't want to be
having kids in, like, a year.

889
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,399
You know?

890
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,234
- Like, that's, like...
- Look.

891
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,317
...very young.

892
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,360
Just...

893
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,654
It doesn't bother me.

894
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:46,780
It doesn't scare me.

895
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,533
I don't think the age matters.

896
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,829
I think the thing for me is, like,
my 20's were so amazing.

897
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,414
With him, I'm, like,

898
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:59,001
are you sure that you would want
to give that up?

899
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:03,255
I mean,
that's a really prime time of your life.

900
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,799
In the outside world,

901
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,885
I would have never looked twice at Mark.

902
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,554
I would have, you know, figured out
his age

903
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,431
or maybe that he was a fitness instructor,

904
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,599
and that would be something

905
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,350
maybe I wouldn't have been into.

906
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,060
Usually, I am someone who runs

907
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,270
before a commitment,

908
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,064
but Mark has exceeded every expectation.

909
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,442
Taking those vows,

910
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,152
it's a huge commitment,

911
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,613
and it's something I take very seriously.

912
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,636
Hello.

913
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,972
- What's up?
- What's up, my baby?

914
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,600
- Hi.
- How are you, my love?

915
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,684
I'm good.

916
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,102
Yeah? You're ready?

917
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,479
Yeah.

918
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,566
Wow.

919
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,111
Wow.

920
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,446
Oh, God.

921
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,092
- Are you going to pass out?
- No, I'm not.

922
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,511
If you are going to pass out,
you have to let me know.

923
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,996
It's crazy.
I'm about to walk down the aisle.

924
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,706
If Jess says...
If Jess says "I do,"

925
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,917
I mean, that "yes" would mean the world.

926
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,543
That's my woman.

927
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,171
That's my little person
who I fought for the entire time.

928
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,421
But who knows?

929
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,133
Maybe she still battling reality
to the experience.

930
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,719
And if she says no, it's going to hurt.

931
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,013
It's going to be physically painful.

932
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,098
Game time.

933
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,266
No turning back now.

934
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,813
Baby, I love you with all my heart.

935
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,272
God bless you.

936
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,274
I think he cares a lot for her,

937
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,485
so I'm hoping that she feels the same.

938
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,445
That's my best hope.

939
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,033
I always put everything in God's hands.

940
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,119
Everything happens for a reason.

941
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,870
- Let's run away.
- No, probably not.

942
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,890
- You and I. Come on.
- Ah, we're here now.

943
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,350
Nope, we're good.

944
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,418
You guys, please welcome your groom.

945
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,637
Good luck.

946
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:42,080
<i>âª In the stillness of the night âª</i>

947
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,876
<i>âª I see your face âª</i>

00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,296

951

You guys, please rise for the bride.

961
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,666

- We're not supposed to do that yet.
- Oh, sorry.

981
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,365
We are gathered here
to celebrate something very special,

982
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,577
the joining together of two lives
into holy matrimony,

983
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,704
better known as marriage.

984
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,038
Jessica and Mark,

985
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,417
in this blind love experiment,
you chose to get engaged

986
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,420
and spend the rest of your lives together

987
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,130
with someone you had not seen.

988
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,548
True love grew,

989
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,218
not from what you look like
on the outside,

990
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,596
but what you saw
on the inside of each other.

991
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,599
- It's okay.
- Jessica,

992
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,851
I want you to know

993
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,687
that no matter what the ups, the downs,

994
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,480
the highs, the lows,

995
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,127
is that I've loved you
from the first time that you said, "Hey,"

996
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,944
which is crazy to even say.

997
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,869
I walked in that room and I knew
that you were different from the rest.

998
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,157
It's been, you know, a lot.

999
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,075
I love that.

1000
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,831
Mark. Marky Mark.

1001
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,209
Thank you

1002
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,877
for putting me here.

1003
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,254
You've been my rock since day one,

1004
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,632
not just because you felt like home,

1005
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,052
but because you opened me up
to new experiences,

1006
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,304
talking about things that I had never

1007
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,804
opened up about.

1008
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,724
And you really pushed me.

1009
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,226
You changed me for the better.

1010
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,519
Thank you for being so open,

1011
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,812
so consistent with me,

1012
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,690
and always being my biggest cheerleader.

1013
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,195
I love you.

1014
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,572
I love you.

1015
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,031
Jessica,

1016
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,491
Mark,

1017
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,913
this is the time to make a commitment
to be husband and wife,

1018
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,207
or walk away from each other forever.

1019
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,422
Now's the time
to decide if love is blind.

1020
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:25,345
Mark Anthony Cuevas,
do you take Jessica Nicole Batten

1021
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,430
to be your lawful wedded wife,

1022
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:30,141
to live together
in the holy estate of matrimony?

1023
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,726
Will you love her,

1024
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560

1025
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,398
honor and keep her,
in sickness and in health,

1026
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,150

1027
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,911

1028
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:55,750
<i>âª This is your heart to break âª</i>

1032
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,597

1033
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,600

1034
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,311

1036

1037
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,458
I love you.

1038
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,356
I cannot.

1039
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,826
I'm so proud of us for...

1040
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,245
getting through the ups and downs,

1041
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,040
but I don't think either one of us

1042
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,000
is ready to take this on,

1043
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,337
but I do want you to know
that I do love you

1044
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,339
so very much,

1045
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,759
and I've always been truthful with you

1046
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,845
because I respect you
so much as a man.

1047
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,767
And you always have
a very special place in my heart.

1048
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,210
- So embarrassing for her.
- I know, right?

1049
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,934
Oh, fuck.

1050
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,450
All I want you to be is okay.

1051
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,533
Listen, listen.

1052
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,120
I don't... Like, I am going to be okay.

1053
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,674
- That's all I need, baby.
- And I don't... I'm gonna be okay.

1054
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:41,748
I'm not...

1055
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,712
Whatever happens, like...
Again, I'm going to be okay.

1056
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,603
Because that's all I have shown
is strength throughout all of this,

1057
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,217
I am going to continue to be that.

1058
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,612
- That's all I want.
- And I'm going to be okay.

1059
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,906
That's all I need to know.
That you are going to be okay.

1060
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,098
I'm going to be fine, Mom.

1061
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,100
Because, you know...

1062
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,687
Me, I'm there for you.

1063
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,147
- I know.
- Day and night.

1064
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,941
And we can talk and we can cry together

1065
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,277
because, as your mom,

1066
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,029
I feel...

1067
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,364
my heart,

1068
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,200

1069
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,580

1075
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,114
Having to say no to someone
at the altar

1076
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,868
is not anything anyone ever wants to do,

1077
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,372
but I'm not walking out of here
with reservations,

1078
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,123
with a wedding band on my finger.

1079
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,000
There's no way in hell.

1080
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,961
Like, I've been around the block,

1081
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,462
my parents are divorced,

1082
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,340
and I'm too much of a realist

1083
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,175
to take this big of a chance.

1084
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,552
I'm not going to do it.

1085
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:20,223
And I guess I'll apologize to whoever
I need to apologize to,

1086
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,225
but I'm not going to apologize to myself

1087
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,269
because I'm not actually sorry.

1088
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,982
I'm going to be okay.

It is just crazy to think that, you know,

1102
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,801
a couple months ago, I was single.
I was living the life.

1118
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,144
<i>âª I'm holding on and I'm not letting go âª</i>

1119
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,194
I never thought
this day would come.

1120
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,445
I never thought,

1121
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,489
going into this experiment,

1122
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,908
that I would ever meet someone,

1123
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,619
let alone be standing here,

1124
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,704
ready to get married.

1125
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,706
- How's it going?
- Good, buddy.

1126
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,958
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks for coming down.

1127
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,128
Today is obviously one
of the biggest days of my life,

1128
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:59,173
and the decision of whether or not
to get married...

1129
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,968
I mean, it's going to change
the whole trajectory

1130
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,053
of not just my life, but Lauren's life.

1131
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,848
Mother!

1132
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,267
- Hey, sweetie!
- Hey, Mom!

1133
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,310
- How are you?
- Good.

1134
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,729
Isn't this just wonderful?

1135
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:13,813
It is.

1136
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,106
Knowing Lauren,

1137
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,984
she'll try certain things

1138
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,320
just to see how it goes,

1139
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,658
but I can't say I'm totally confident

1140
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:30,329
because I've only seen them
together for a couple hours,

1141
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,166
and this is an experiment, so...

1142
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,084
we'll see how it turns out.

1143
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,754
So, how do you feel?

1144
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,006
Nervous. I don't know.

1145
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:43,176
I never thought
that I would see this day so soon.

1146
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,137
I feel a lot of different emotions
right now.

1147
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,098
I mean, I'm happy, I'm excited.

1148
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:53,102
But, I mean, there's still a part of me
that's very terrified.

1149
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,522
Even a little part of me
that may feel a little unsure.

1150
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,399
Oh, really?

1151
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,068
Oh, Lauren.

1152
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,528
Don't cry.

1153
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:06,532
Cameron has made me feel
unlike any man that I've ever known.

1154
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,744
We truly and honestly connected
on levels so deep,

1155
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:13,039
but right now I'm still undecided.

1156
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,041
I think I won't really decide

1157
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,794
until the words actually
come out of my mouth,

1158
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,713
and, regardless of what that decision is,

1159
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,341
I just hope that it's the best choice
for me

1160
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,092
and Cameron.

1161
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,890
I felt so calm up until today,

1162
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,392
and now I'm starting
to feel a little nervous.

1163
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,978
So what are you nervous about?

1164
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,941
I guess I'm just nervous about whether...

1165
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,193
she still wants to get married.

1166
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:47,865
Um, well, you already know that you're,
like, the first white guy I've dated.

1167
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:48,949
Uh-huh.

1168
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,286
I want it to be your home.

1169
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,122
Yeah, you want me to live here with you?

1170
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:56,958
I do.

1171
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,794
I would love to. I do love my place.

1172
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,629
How would you feel if I kept it?

1173
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,296
Um, well...

1174
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,299
I don't know.

1175
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,176
Damn.

1176
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,804
The invitations just...

1177
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:13,808
make everything, like, you know...
It's no turning back now.

1178
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,143
It's like, just pressure.

1179
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:19,146
We're getting married
in not that much time.

1180
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:22,733
And, I mean, I still don't know

1181
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,195
completely what you're going to say.

1182
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:30,074
And I don't want to say a definite answer.

1183
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,704
I think that she's ready now,

1184
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:36,914
but...

1185
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,166
I don't know. I don't know for sure.

1186
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,671
- Hi.
- Hi.

1187
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:46,632
- Tiffany and Rachel!
- Hi.

1188
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,094
My bridesmaids are here.
My good friend Tiffany,...

1189
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,219
Look at this coat.

1190
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,930
...and my first cousin Rachel.

1191
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,850
I love the fact that they're here
to support me and my decision,

1192
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,977
no matter what it is,
so that means a lot to me.

1193
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,982
<i>âª La la la la love âª</i>

1194
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,525
<i>âª Don't need anything, but âª</i>

1195
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,778
<i>âª La la la la love
Don't want anything, but âª</i>

1196
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,239
- All right, mom, you're good.
- Oh, all right.

1197
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,184
He looks like James Bond.

1198
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,953
Cameron Bond, right there.

1199
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:18,915
This is my way of...

1200
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,583
- I guess...
- What?

1201
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,002
Yeah, I'm ready for a beer.

1202
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,672
This is crazy.

1203
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,840
I know.

1204
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,176
We were in Paris,
living our best life.

1205
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,510
I know.

1206
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,680
Then I came home and got married.

1207
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:39,620
You just pop up like,
"Hey, girl. Let's get something to eat."

1208
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,978
And she's like,

1209
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:44,231
"I'm engaged and I want you to be
a bridesmaid."

1210
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,359
All within, eating the same...

1211
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,082
- What was it? Salad?
- In the same bread.

1212
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,821
- Yeah, like what the heck?
- In the same salad.

1213
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:51,948
This is crazy.

1214
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,742
Okay, Momma. Look at you!

1215
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,160
All right!

1216
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,579
Whose wedding is it, mine or yours?

1217
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,915
And she's coming in
shrugging her shoulders.

1218
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,458
Yeah.

1219
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,669
Hi, everyone.

1220
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:06,212
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

1221
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,130
Wow, they've got you in the wine cellar?

1222
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,465
- How nice. How nice.
- Yeah.

1223
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,693
- Oh, baby, how are you doing?
- Good, how are you, Mom?

1224
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,052
Mm, I don't even know.

1225
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,973
- Can I say that?
- Yeah, you can say anything.

1226
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:20,476
I'm really happy that I'm getting
some time with my mom.

1227
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,812
This is the hardest for her,

1228
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,773
and she feels like
she's losing her baby boy.

1229
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,607
How are you feeling?
Are you feeling okay about it?

1230
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,820
Not worried about anything?

1231
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,446
Let's just hope that she is still...

1232
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,031
still on board.

1233
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,616
You think she might not be?

1234
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,368
Uh...

1235
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:40,395
I mean, this is a crazy situation
in many respects,

1236
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:41,998
so I don't think there'd be any shame

1237
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,792
if she said no or didn't,
you know, whatever.

1238
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:45,876
Yeah.

1239
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,379
- I wouldn't blame her.
- But you would be devastated.

1240
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,339
- Of course I'd be devastated, yeah.
- Yeah.

1241
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,674
With Lauren,

1242
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:55,302
in no time at all,
I knew I wanted to marry her,

1243
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,304
so if she were to say no,

1244
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,851
I don't know how long it would be
until I would be all right again.

1245
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,312
Or if I would ever be all right again.

1246
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,774
I am taking a leap of faith.

1247
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,068
Even in the...

1248
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:14,905
you know, most sure situations,
it is still a leap of faith.

1249
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,157
Yeah.

1250
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:17,742
Oh, boy.

1251
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:18,826
It's a big step.

1252
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,661
Did you ever think about me
getting married?

1253
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,329
Um...

1254
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,289
No.

1255
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,669
You know, because you're still 12
in my mind.

1256
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:29,855
- Yeah.
- You know.

1257
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,840
So, um, I'd like you to be 12 again.

1258
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,887
You know, I will always be your son.

1259
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,264
- We love you.
- I love you too.

1260
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:42,808
We want the best for you,

1261
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,644
and I don't want your heart to be broken.

1262
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:46,728
I know.

1263
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:52,193
Okay, how does that feel? Oh, my God.

1264
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:53,694
Feels tight.

1265
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,197
- Tight?
- I mean, but that's good I guess.

1266
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,866
Oh, my God. You look so pretty.

1267
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,951
Thank you. Okay, Mom.

1268
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,239
- That fits like a glove.
- It does.

1269
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:06,874
This is it.

1270
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,168
- Okay.
- I'm in the dress now.

1271
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,129
- No turning back.
- Are your knees, like, knocking?

1272
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,215
My heart is like beating real hard.

1273
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,217
The thought of...

1274
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:20,054
me being a married woman,
like, within the next hour

1275
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,056
gives me crazy anxiety.

1276
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:23,933
This is a wonderful, beautiful day,

1277
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,019
and we are so truly blessed,

1278
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:28,437
and we pray

1279
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:32,483
that our life,
Lauren's life, and Cameron's life

1280
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,777
will come together as one.

1281
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,573
<i>âª I'm trying so hard to figure it out âª</i>

1282
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:43,327
<i>âª Everything just seems so heavy now âª</i>

1283
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,222
You know,
it's a lifelong commitment,

1284
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,998
and I don't think
that it's anything to play with,

1285
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:50,084
and I take it very seriously.

1286
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,090
- Daddy!
- Hi, baby.

1287
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,466
Hi, Daddy.

1288
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,345
Don't cry.

1289
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,431
You look beautiful.

1290
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,684
You look beautiful. Look at you.

1291
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,685
Look at my baby.

1292
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,312
I'm so thankful I can stand here
and see you like this.

1293
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,482
- You look absolutely beautiful.
- Thank you, Daddy.

1294
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,192
She's my princess still,

1295
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,653
and I guess when you have those moments,

1296
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:20,364
when you think about one day,
she's going to grow up,

1297
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:22,199
and get married, and have a husband,

1298
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,743
and that day comes when you have
to walk down the aisle,

1299
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:27,121
and let her go,
let her go into the world.

1300
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:28,038
So, you know,

1301
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,583
a little nervous, a little excited,

1302
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:32,293
and a little

1303
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:34,420
just plain scared.

1304
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,339
Needless to say, I've loved you
since you've been in this world.

1305
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:40,134
From the moment I looked at you
when you were born.

1306
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,179
Since you've been in this world,
you know, we've been like this.

1307
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:46,223
My dad is a huge focal point
in my life.

1308
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,391
He's so loving,

1309
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:50,519
so it's definitely a sigh of relief

1310
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,980
to have my dad here to support me.

1311
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,065
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Daddy.

1312
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,318
- I'm trying. I'm really trying.
- I know.

1313
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,071
You're not losing me.

1314
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:03,657
Well, you're still my daughter.

1315
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,389
But you're gonna be this man's wife.

1316
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,251
Just let me in every time I knock,
that's all.

1317
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,539
I love you so much.

1318
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,382
- I love you too, Daddy.
- I love you so much.

1319
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,430
- I love you, honey.
- I love you, Mom.

1320
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,850
In just moments now,

1321
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,770
I'm going to go to the altar,
Lauren's going to walk down that aisle,

1322
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:34,396
and she's either going to say yes

1323
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,107
and we're going to spend
the rest of our lives together

1324
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,776
as husband and wife, or...

1325
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:42,363
maybe she'll say no,
and that might be the end.

1326
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,661
<i>My anxiety is just through the roof.</i>

1327
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,790
<i>I am about to make
the biggest decision of my life.</i>

1328
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,459
<i>I mean, am I going to marry this man</i>

1329
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:59,296
<i>who I have fallen in love with
only six weeks ago,</i>

1330
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:03,342
<i>or am I going to walk away
to follow my own comfort</i>

1331
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,135
<i>and things that I know?</i>

1332
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:09,098
<i>This is the moment
that every little girl dreams of.</i>

1333
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:11,183
<i>Like, I'm here in this dress</i>

1334
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,893
<i>preparing to walk down the aisle.</i>

1335
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,395
<i>This is all very real.</i>

1336
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,563
- I love you, sweetheart.
- I love you too, Daddy.

1337
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:19,984
He's a lucky man.

1338
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,115
Please stand

1339
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,700
as we bring in our beautiful bride.

1340
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:55,978
- Love you, sweetheart.
- Love you, too.

1341
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:58,522
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?

1342
01:11:58,981 --> 01:11:59,981
I do.

1343
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,695
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

1344
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,948
Every day that we've spent together

1345
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:09,950
has been a blessing to me.

1346
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,706
There's so much I love about you.

1347
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:24,757
I'm sorry I'm crying, but...

1348
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,593
It's okay. I have been crying all day.

1349
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:35,059
You made me want to be a better man,

1350
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:39,521
and you have everything
that I need in a partner.

1351
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:42,816
I feel very blessed

1352
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,526
to have you in my life.

1353
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:48,280
That's beautiful.

1354
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,910
Cameron, I love that you...

1355
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:56,455
make me feel comfortable
being fully myself.

1356
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:00,084
No matter how flawed, goofy,

1357
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,668
or broken I may have been.

1358
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,714
I'm thankful for our time together

1359
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:07,966
and how happy our moments are.

1360
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:13,180
I've never had a man love me as purely

1361
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,599
and selflessly as you have.

1362
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,811
I'm grateful for the things

1363
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:22,189
that have made me uncomfortable
and forced me to grow.

1364
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:23,732
Nice.

1365
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:24,983
I'm grateful for you.

1366
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,653
Mineâs more short,

1367
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,031
but I meant it, damn it,
I meant... I'm sorry.

1368
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:33,093
Pastor, I didn't mean to curse.

1369
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,786
I didn't mean to curse, Lord, Jesus.

1370
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,247
Okay.

1371
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,832
Lauren and Cameron...

1372
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:45,379
...now is the time to decide
if love is truly blind.

1373
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:48,257
Your love developed
in an untraditional way,

1374
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,844
based on an intense emotional connection.

1375
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:55,305
Looks, money, age, and race

1376
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,932
that might be important to some people

1377
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,809
was not a factor for you two.

1378
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:01,061
And now today,

1379
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:02,563
you stand together

1380
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,315
in the presence of your family,
your friends,

1381
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:06,483
and almighty God

1382
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:10,112
to decide if love is blind,

1383
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,823
and whether or not to face life together

1384
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,950
as husband and wife,

1385
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:17,828
or walk away from each other forever.

1386
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,123
Cameron Reid Hamilton,

1387
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,377
do you take Lauren Michelle Speed

1388
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,671
to be your lawful wedded wife,

1389
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:31,383
to live together
in the holy estate of matrimony?

1390
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,302
Will you love her,

1391
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:35,052
comfort her,

1392
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:36,638
honor and keep her,

1393
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,682
so long as you both shall live?

1394
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,560
I do.

1395
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,573
The love that I have for you
is so strong

1396
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,992
that it's overwhelming sometimes.

1397
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,579
Being with you makes me feel thankful.

1398
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:01,996
Oh.

1399
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:14,259
Lauren Michelle Speed,
do you take Cameron Reid Hamilton

1400
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,929
to be your lawful wedded husband,

1401
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:20,349
to live together
in the holy estate of matrimony?

1402
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,100
Will you love him,

1403
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,601
comfort him,

1404
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,270
honor and keep him,

1405
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,732
so long as you both shall live?

1406
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:57,176
I do.

1407
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,644
Lauren and Cameron, today,
you guys have definitely proved

1408
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,938
that love is blind.

1409
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:09,355
Amen.

1410
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:14,903
You may now call yourself
those cherished names of husband and wife.

1411
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:18,490
You may now kiss your bride.

1412
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:30,877
We're married. Yay!

1413
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,214
- We made it.
- We made it.

1414
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,508
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure to introduce you

1415
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,594
for the first time
as husband and wife,

1416
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:43,432
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron and Lauren Hamilton.

1417
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,526
Thank you, Mommy.

1418
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,028
Love you.

1419
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,156
Thank you. Oh.

1420
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:07,371
Oh, my God.

1421
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:08,957
We did it, babe.

1422
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,084
We did it. We're married.

1423
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:12,377
We're married.

1424
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,421
- Unreal.
- It is.

1425
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,341
- But it's definitely real.
- It's very real.

1426
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:18,424
Super real.

1427
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,386
I love you.

1428
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,430
I love you so much, baby.

1429
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:25,849
I promise I'm going
to take care of you, baby.

1430
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:27,559
I know you will, baby.

1431
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,477
You know what?

1432
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,023
I don't think that I ever could have met
someone like Cameron any other way.

1433
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,901
I've been looking for Cameron
for 30 years!

1434
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:39,363
Apparently, he was looking for me, too.
I'm glad we finally found each other.

1435
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,867
Oh, hey!

1436
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,162
Hey, everybody!

1437
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,498
Oh, beautiful. You're beautiful.

1438
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:51,667
This is my husband, Cameron.

1439
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,669
It's my gorgeous wife, Lauren.

1440
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,337
- Oh!
- Amazing woman.

1441
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,507
âª <i>I've been searching âª</i>

1442
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,759
âª <i>And looking âª</i>

1443
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,844
âª <i>And wishing âª</i>

1444
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,930
âª <i>And dreaming âª</i>

1445
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:09,685
She has everything that I've always
dreamed about in a partner.

1446
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:13,021
She's charismatic,
but she's down-to-earth.

1447
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,399
She's confident, but she's also humble.

1448
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:16,816
She's intelligent.

1449
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:17,901
She's kind.

1450
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:21,488
I'm just so thankful
that we got to meet each other

1451
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:25,867
through this albeit unorthodox method.

1452
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,620
<i>âª Finally mine âª</i>

1453
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:32,541
I fell in love with Lauren
without ever having seen her.

1454
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:36,044
<i>âª Finally mine âª</i>

1455
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,422
It's amazing to say Lauren is my wife.

1456
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,383
I'm happy I locked it down.

1457
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,516
I absolutely believe that love is blind.

1458
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,811
Six weeks ago, I was extremely hopeful.

1459
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:54,271
I had an open mind,

1460
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:57,649
but I can say honestly I did not expect

1461
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,234
for things to go this far.

1462
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:01,111
I mean, that was my hope and dream,

1463
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:03,989
but this is bigger than anything
I could have ever imagined.

1464
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:06,450
You know, I'm just grateful
for everything.

1465
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:11,246
This experience and experiment
truly changed my life.

1466
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:16,626
<i>âª Finally... âª</i>

1467
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:22,215
<i>âª Mine âª</i>

1468
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:26,386
<i>âª Remember when we used to dream âª</i>

1469
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:30,056
I came into this hoping
to find someone that loves me

1470
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,516
for what's on the inside.

1471
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:33,643
Even though Jessica and I
did not get married,

1472
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,855
I strongly believe that love is blind
because I made that commitment

1473
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:39,107
to propose through
just an emotional connection.

1474
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:43,361
I think if she had remembered that,
I think we would have been all right.

1475
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,031
<i>âª But they'd never shoot across the sky
For your and I âª</i>

1476
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:50,327
<i>âª So we kept our wish inside âª</i>

1477
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,621
When I was in the pods,

1478
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:57,000
I was in my feelings so much
that the outside world didn't exist to me.

1479
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:59,169
I grew so much. I challenged myself.

1480
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:01,338
I got so far out of my comfort zone.

1481
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:04,883
And I connected with someone
so deep, I could have never imagined.

1482
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:09,596
But I couldn't translate that
from pod to real life.

1483
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:11,326
For some people, love might be blind.

1484
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:14,518
But for me, it's definitely not.
It's a mixture of...

1485
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:16,353
mind, body, and soul,

1486
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:19,481
and I never got there.

1487
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:20,899
So that's really hard.

1488
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:24,277
<i>âª Baby we canât change the past âª</i>

1489
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:28,782
<i>âª Erase the scars
That hold together a broken heart âª</i>

1490
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:31,385
I believe that soulmates
can come and go into your life,

1491
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:33,453
that they're not always there forever.

1492
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:36,081
Um, you learn lessons from people

1493
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:38,250
that touch your soul
in so many different ways,

1494
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,503
but in the end,
making the right decision for you

1495
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:43,338
is the right decision for everybody.

1496
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:46,049
<i>âª Or we could try

We wonât cry for our yesterdays âª</i>

1498
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,947
You sit and you want
to have a pity party.

1499
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:53,723
There's no pity party
because I have ultimate control.

1500
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,684
There's more nice people
than there are bad.

1501
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,687
So yeah, like, I will have my day,

1502
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,314
and I'll be with that person
I need to be with,

1503
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:03,358
but today is not that day.

1504

1506
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:13,910
I never thought that
I would find my soulmate in a dark room.

1507
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,121
I don't regret anything.

1508
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:17,956
I'm mourning,

1509
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:20,375
but from the ashes comes...

1510
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,210
the phoenix.

1511
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:25,422
<i>âª Or we could try

1514

<i>I was hoping to find that with G.</i>

1515
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,099

<i>Mr. and Mrs. Barnett!</i>

1519
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:50,780
It was a relief

1520
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,742
to see that he was actually
at the end of the aisle waiting for me.

1521
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:56,661
I was really happy I wasn't going to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

1522
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,960
Considering, where I was in life

1523
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:07,464
right before I came into this experience,

1524
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:10,842
I would never in a million years
have guessed

1525
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:14,679
that I would be in a wedding gown
right now

1526
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,099
with a ring on my finger
and a whole new last name.

1527
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,809
I wouldn't have believed it.

1528
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:21,478
Uh...

1529
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,064
- Was that right?
- Here you go.

1530

No regrets. Not today.

1531
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,445
Maybe... we'll see.
We'll see down the road.

1532
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,404

1535
01:22:38,828 --> 01:22:42,499
Six weeks ago, I was hopeful,
but skeptical of this experiment,

1536
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:44,834
and now I'm a full-on believer.

And that's it.

I'm off the market, baby.

1540

The fact that Cameron and I

without ever even seeing each other,

1542

it's like what we saw
