1
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,346
Will you marry me?

2
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,564
I wanted to tell you something.

3
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,694
One thing that I don't believe in is...

4
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,904
roles.

5
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,865
Or labels.

6
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,366
I do whatever I want.

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,163
And what I want you to do is
I want you to stand up.

8
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,542
I'm standing.

9
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,625
So...

10
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,004
throughout this whole thing,

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,923
I have been trying to find my soulmate.

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,885
I see you as my equal.

13
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,554
And I'm just as strong as you.

14
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,184
So I want to ask you,

15
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,934
Damian Powers,

16
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,771
will you marry me?

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,483
I will marry you.

18
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,443
I'll marry you, too!

19
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,403
- I accept.
<i>- </i>I accept, too.

20
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,739
Oh, fuck.

21
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,241
I love you.

22
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,202
I love you, too.

23
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,622
I never expected that.

24
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,208
You scared the shit out of me.

25
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,959
I wanted to surprise you.

26
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,628
You surprised me.

27
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,547
I cannot wait to hold you.

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,842
I'm going to break this thing down
in like two seconds.

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,181
So, I'm engaged to a man that I've never
seen before and that is so me.

30
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,309
That's something that I would do.

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,770
I can't wait to see you, Damian.

32
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,897
You're amazing.

33
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,316
And I look forward...

34
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,778
to spending the rest of my life with you.

35
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,237
Me, too.

36
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,156
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

43
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,559
Today, I feel strongly towards two people,

44
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,642
but I, you know...

45
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,105
Like, I try to avoid
that conflict as well, I guess.

46
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,359
I really want to be married,

47
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,404
but I'm so scared of making
the wrong decision. So...

48
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,073
So, um..

49
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,493
my indecisiveness is killing me
right now.

50
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,955
I know I'm confused in the head.
I don't know what's going on right now.

51
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,959
You told Jessica, "I can see you being
my wife" and all this stuff.

52
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,501
You said that.

53
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,690
But you weren't honest to everyone else
on how you felt about that.

54
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,608
Not just me.
I'm talking about the other two girls.

55
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,792
Yeah, you're right.

56
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,844
Communicate. It sucks.

57
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,262
The conversations fucking blow.

58
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,055
It is fucking awful to be...

59
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,107
The conversation with Jessica
I had yesterday

60
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,976
was the toughest I've had,
ever in my life.

61
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,021
Jessica was conflicted on what was
going on.

62
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,314
She was going back and forth.

63
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,692
And now she's telling me
she's committed to me

64
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,486
and I don't want to be like Barnett:

65
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,946
wishy-washy, uncertain.

66
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,532
Because I know what I want.
And that's Jessica.

67
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,493
Accept the conflict.
Accept it's going to happen,

68
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,329
- and fucking go for it.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:31,044
<i>♪ I can still remember
To the night when I surrendered ♪</i>

70
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,963
<i>♪ And we started spinning out of control ♪</i>

71
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,216
I found my person, which is Jessica,

72
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,345
and I've never in my entire life been
able to open up

73
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,847
the way I have with her
and built this connection with her.

74
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,974
I can honestly say I found the woman

75
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,393
that I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

76
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,063
All I hope is that there's
no doubt in her mind

77
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,940
that I'm the man she wants to be with.

78
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,157
- Hello?
- Hey, babe.

79
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,493
Oh, God, hearing your voice...

80
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,830
It's literally the best thing... Oh, man.

81
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,083
The first time I heard your voice,
I just knew.

82
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,337
And there's no words that can ever,
ever, ever...

83
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,507
That I could even describe
to the feeling that you give me

84
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,051
and I promised each and
every day that I will love you...

85
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,970
even when times are tough.

86
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,846
I promise you to be that rock.

87
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,557
I've never been so certain
about something in my life,

88
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,185
and it's so hard
for me to let people in.

89
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,605
And for you, I let you in
and I love every second of it.

90
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,442
Jessica, you have my heart
and there's nobody in this world

91
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,611
that I would rather
spend the rest of my life with.

92
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,989
I want you to picture

93
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,782
this kid from Chicago,

94
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,993
with his heart in his hands,

95
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,537
getting down on one knee,

96
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,290
and Jessica...

97
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,711
I want to ask you...

98
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,212
Will you marry me?

99
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,853
Hello?

100
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,897
Yes.

101
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,944
Of course.

102
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,112
Of course I will.

103
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,656
I want to kiss you, I want to hug you.

104
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,992
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

105
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,162
I love you.
I feel like I came into this...

106
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,372
Like, I honestly felt like

107
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,665
God put me here.

108
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,666
I don't know why.

109
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,669
I was like, "This is so weird,
what am I doing?"

110
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,381
But I just want like forever with you.
I don't want this to ever end.

111
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,883
I'm so happy right now.

112
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,844
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

113
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,858
My heart's beating out of my chest.

114
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,349
Oh, God. Like, I love you.
And I mean that.

115
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,060
- I love you.
- I love you.

116
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,644
I just got engaged.

117
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,647
I did.

118
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,651
It's been 20 years
of pushing off commitment,

119
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,988
but it was easy to commit
to Mark today.

120
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,158
Love is so blind.
I'm marrying a 24 year old.

121
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,996
Oh, my God.

122
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,498
I tried to push him away,

123
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,334
because that's what I do,
and he wouldn't let me.

124
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,504
And now he is my fiancé.

125
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,506
I'm so excited.

126
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,427
I'm happy. We're good!

127
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,262
I'm excited. Let's do it, like...

128
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,224
- I'm excited, too!
- Whoo!

129
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,101
A lot of people try to say

130
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,269
you should wait until you're 28, 29, 30.

131
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,398
I'm like, but when you find that person,
why wait?

132
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,235
But next time, babe, Jessica,
answer and then cry,

133
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,405
'cause I about had a heart attack
at age 24, so...

134
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,322
My God, I'm...

135
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,575
I wish you could see me right now.

136
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,995
I want you to enjoy the rest of this day

137
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,415
and we got the rest of our lives.

138
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,292
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

142
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,809
Being in love with Barnett
is a roller-coaster...

143
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,353
The way he's been interacting
with other girls...

144
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,023
seems so indecisive.

145
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,025
I'm not the only one in this,

146
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,027
so I don't know, you know,

147
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,904
what's in Barnett's mind.

148
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,990
And if it's just feels like such...

149
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,951
high stakes right now.

150
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,541
Even though I feel like I know
who he's wanting to be with,

151
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,625
and it's me,

152
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,211
I don't know that for sure.

153
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,505
I don't even put myself around Amber
at this point.

154
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,632
I just think it's an exhausting thing
to be around.

155
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,510
Honestly, I don't see Barnett
with anyone else.

156
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,431
If he does end up with her,
then I was clearly way off.

157
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,308
Like, way off,

158
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,478
about the kind of person he is
and wants in a wife.

159
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,490
I mean I'm probably, like,
one of the luckiest guys

160
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,824
in the world right now.

161
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,160
Like, I have two freaking amazing people

162
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,662
that are so interested in me.

163
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,290
But how can two people be so sure

164
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,001
and I'm over here, like...
I have no freaking clue.

165
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:27,423
I have a huge fear of having
this initial spark with someone

166
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,258
and it just fizzling out.

167
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,802
And the intensity of Amber...

168
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,555
like, I'm scared
that it's not going to last.

169
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,808
LC...

170
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,103
I know she'll love me and I know...

171
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,731
it may not be as intense as Amber,

172
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,442
but it could be for a long time
and it won't burn out.

173
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,196
Honestly, I thought about
not proposing to either one.

174
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,293
I don't want to hurt someone
and I know it's going to happen.

175
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,663
And I'm feeling
the fucking pain right now.

176
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,542
It's the...

177
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,461
For sure, the toughest decision
I've ever had to make.

178
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,346
So...

179
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,520
I know I've put you through...

180
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,774
probably one of the hardest experiences
of your life.

181
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,900
This has, uh...

182
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,236
been...

183
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,696
It's been the toughest...

184
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,739
thing I've ever had to do.

185
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,993
I've thought...

186
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,787
everyday and I've...

187
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,208
I've tried to think, you know,
what my future holds

188
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,794
and, you know,
what's the right decision for me.

189
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,005
You know, I have to follow my heart.

190
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,802
It's, it's...

191
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,219
It's not you, LC.

192
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,730
- I literally can't even cry anymore.
- I know.

193
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,735
Like, you just don't have any regard
for what you're doing to people.

194
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,695
Otherwise, you wouldn't have done
this to me.

195
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,156
I would have never...

196
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,657
never...

197
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,159
let you get to this point

198
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,578
if it were me instead of you
in that position.

199
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,623
This is my real life
and my real feelings, and...

200
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,706
I know.

201
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,918
You're not really the person
I thought you were, honestly.

202
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,589
Have a great life.
I'm walking out the door.

203
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,801

Ever?

208

It's not just here.

209
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,944
Like, I feel like they're always,

Like, I don't know what I'm doing

Or am I just like...

I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

220
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:37,571
Marriage is a big deal to me
because it's a lifelong commitment.

221
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,574
I've never wanted to get married
unless I felt like it was right.

222
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,953
If I'm going to spend the rest of my life
with this person, I want to make sure...

223
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,831
that it's going to be someone
that I'm going to...

225
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,709
Okay.

226
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,168
Amber, um...

227
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,838
you...

228
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,465

232
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,559
But...

233
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,277
Oh, shit.

234
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Amber...

235
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,823
Will you marry me?

236
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,789
Oh...

00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,254
Oh, my God.

Yes.

00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,257
- Was that "yes"?
- Yes!

240
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,467
- Yes?
- Yes!

241
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,926
Fuck, okay. Whoo!

242
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,970

<i>It's just the spark

251
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,618
Amber...

252
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,746
look at me. Look at me.

But you're gonna make me
the happiest man in the world.

Oh, shit.

00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,515
Whoo!

261
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,118
- I already told you I love you, right?
- Yeah.

262
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,435
- I do love you.
- Yeah.

263
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,394
Ah!

264
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,312
Yeah.

265
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,527
Phew.

266
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,917
I have insecurities
when it comes to...

267
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,086
how I look.

268
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,256
What will she think of me?
She's such a...

269
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,009
spiritual and loving, kind soul,

270
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,512
that I don't think she's looking
for somebody...

271
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,972
for looks.

272
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,392
She has touched me without touching me.

273
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,351
And...

274
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,231
for the first time in my life,
I think somebody's finally...

275
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,067
seen me without seeing me.

276
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,119
I want to just stare at him.

277
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,162
I just want to process him,

278
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,332
see if he matched
what I thought in my head.

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,878
I have no idea what I'm going to do
when I see Damian.

280
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,547
I don't know if I'm going to laugh,
or if I'm going to cry,

281
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,632
or if I'm gonna pass out,
or if I'm gonna throw up,

282
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,342
I have no idea.

283
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,386
Oh, God. Hurry up.

284
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,733

00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,535
Oh, my God, I love you.

286
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,330
Finally.

287
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,500
Oh my God, you're so strong.

288
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,711
Hi.

289
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,463
Hi.

290
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,341
Hey.

291
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Hey.

292
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,762
Mm.

293
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,351
She is stunning.

294
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,102
I mean, she took my breath away.

295
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,979
Her smile was so bright,

296
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,441
her skin tone's so soft
and so fucking...

297
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,567
It's beautiful.

298
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,111
It's so different
and I love different because...

299
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,738
different is beautiful.

300
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,990
Who knew I could get so deep? Ah!

301
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,201
This girl brings out a lot of stuff in me.

302
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,412
You have really pretty eyes.

303
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,332
- Beautiful eyes.
- You have such pretty eyes.

304
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,042
Today I give you me.

305
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,418
I give you all of me.

306
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,962
Wow.

307
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,881
- So, tonight you have a piece of me.
- Good.

308
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,801
Damian.

309
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,596
- Dame.
- Dame.

310
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Dame.

311
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,015
G.

312
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,934
It's interesting.

313
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,479
Because I pictured you, obviously.

314
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,065
I never pictured this.

315
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,775
I love how Damian looks.

316
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,903
I love it. I can stare at him forever.

317
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,365
But my old habits
would have been like "Wait.

318
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,284
Now I'm doubting myself."

319
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,703
'Cause I self-sabotage.

320
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,747
And I didn't do that with Damian.

321
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,164
I am...

322
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,625
so happy.

323
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,421
I can <i>finally</i> let that wall down.

324
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,510
Giannina...

325
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,095
She is fucking beautiful.

326
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,974
I'm sorry for the F-bomb, excuse me,
but she is gorgeous.

327
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,395
I hope she's going back thinking,
"He is a handsome man."

328
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,065
It's crazy that in just four weeks,

329
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,566
Giannina...

330
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,028
is going to be my wife.

331
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,030
I am...

332
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,032
I'm a... I'm a lucky man.

333
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,077
I see you.

334
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,078
Mm.

335
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,344
Barnett has chosen me to be his wife

336
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,556
and he has gotten
a whole crazy handful.

337
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,808
He just...

338
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,936
refused to let me love him!

339
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,898
And he finally gave in.

340
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,824
Today, I get to meet my fiancée.

341
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,915
Oh, it's giving me butterflies.

342
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,293
Roller coaster.

343
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,546
Let's hit that drop, come on.

344
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,507
I'm nervous as hell.

345
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,342
What if she doesn't like me? I don't know.

346
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,678
I haven't,
throughout this entire process,

347
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,097
been able to picture his face.

348
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,601
I haven't been able to fabricate
anything that I feel like

349
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,645
is close enough to who he is.

350
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,857
I'm really hoping for a nice smile
and pretty eyes,

351
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,069
'cause I'm a sucker for both,
but<i> c'est la vie.</i>

352
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,487
Oh, God.

353
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,161
Okay.

354
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,794
Oh, gosh.

355
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,511
- Oh, shit.
- Hi.

356
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,763
Holy fuck.

357
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,598
- Hello.
- Hi!

358
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,682
Oh, God.

359
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,018
Hello. Oh, my gosh.

360
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,811
Oh, God.

361
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,398
Oh, God.

362
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,443
- Wow.
- Hi.

363
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,028
- Holy shit. Hello.
- Hi.

364
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,196
Hi.

365
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,032
Mm.

366
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,958
- Hi.
- Hey.

367
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,751
How's it going?

368
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,711
Wow.

369
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,880
Did you know the whole time
he looked like that?

370
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,007
Like that's...

371
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,593
That's my fiancé.

372
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,345
All right, I'm going to need
this hand real quick.

373
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,639
I refuse to let you change
your mind again.

374
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,323
I'm gonna stick that on there right now.

375
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,061
Barnett...

376
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,565
frustrates me and he irks my nerves

377
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,985
and he drives me to the ends of insanity,
and...

378
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,155
I fucking love him.

379
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,407
I adore him for it.

380
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,243
Like, I love that he challenges me

381
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,328
and makes me laugh.

382
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,080
And I love the way he makes me feel and...

383
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,541
y'all, I love the way he feels. Oof.

384
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,168
I'm just...

385
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,296
I couldn't be happier right now.

386
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,675
- Oh, my God.
- Don't you dare snort on me.

387
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,763
I got something for you, too.

388
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,515
I had actually picked something out, so...

389
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,017
Is that for me?

390
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,185
- Yes.
- Is that mine?

391
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,388
Hopefully it fits.

392
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,770
Oh, Jesus.

393
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,731
Hell, yeah, this is
the fucking right decision.

394
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,148
Yeah.

395
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,735
Damn, I'm lucky. Shit.

396
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,987
I wasn't nervous at all, but damn.

397
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,239
I was a little nervous.

398
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,699
Oh, God.

399
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,951
Oh, my God.

400
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,871
- I just want to...
- I'm okay.

401
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,498
Snuggle me real quick.

402
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,701
Don't ever let go.
I'm not going to let you.

403
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,044
They're not going to take you
away from me.

404
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,547
I'm engaged, y'all!

405
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,882
Oh, my God.

406
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,051
I'm engaged.

407
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,596
Oh, my God.

408
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,392
You're so irritating.

409
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,394
I know I am. I know I am.

410
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,604
I'll always be that way.

411
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,233
Barnett has put me through the wringer.

412
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:24,241
And I have no doubt
he will probably do it again.

413
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,742
Open the door.

414
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,124
But I am still, and always have been,
up for the challenge

415
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,669
and it feels really good to know
that he is, too.

416
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,338
- Hi.
- Hey.

417
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,638
I never thought
I would come out of this engaged

418
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,599
and definitely never thought I would
come out of this engaged to that...

419
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,643
freaking smokin' hot piece of...

420
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,770
sexiness.

421
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,272
Holy shit.

422
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,774
Finally. Finally.

423
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,987
It's literally the most

424
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,698
freaking beautiful girl I've seen
in my entire life.

425
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,782
Mm.

426
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,534
I'm going to miss you.

427
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,704
Yeah, you are.

428
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,665
Yeah, I am. Yeah, I am.

429
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,340
I'm so glad I didn't let my stupid brain
fuck this up.

430
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,091
See you soon.

431
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,595
<i>♪ Seize the day ♪</i>

432
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,847
<i>♪ Make it never bring you down ♪</i>

433
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,267
<i>♪ You go and do it anyway ♪</i>

434
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,811
Ah!

435
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,025
Oh, God.

436
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,656
Whoo!

437
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,662
Me and my fiancé get to go
on a vacation

438
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:57,793
and I am ecstatic to get to see what...

439
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:02,297
this connection is going to be like
in the physical world.

440
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:07,386
I'm gonna just need to forewarn you guys,
you are not allowed in our hotel room.

441
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,304
Y'all got to stay out.

442
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:21,149
This experiment for me has
changed my life and I'm 34 years old.

443
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,611
I... thought maybe this was something
that would never happen to me.

444
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,238
It happened. It happened!

445
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,906
Ah.

446
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,868
I'm engaged to someone
10 years younger than me.

447
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,704
I never would have expected
that to happen.

448
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,999
I didn't think about the possibility
of someone...

449
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,292
so much younger

450
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,796
really becoming my everything.

451
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,383
But, yeah, I'm 100%
head-over-heels in love.

452
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,599
Jessica, I love you, baby.

453
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,352
I'm going to make you the happiest woman
in the world,

454
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,479
no matter what conflict is in front of us.

455
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,983
No matter what adversity, obstacle...

456
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,860
You're my person.

457
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,194
Thank you for choosing me.

458
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,989
I couldn't be more thankful
to be with you.

459
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:17,205
I found the one, and it does not matter
to me at all what he looks like.

460
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,834
If he's a troll, I literally don't care.

461
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:25,255
I found full-blown love
like I've never experienced before

462
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:29,259
and it didn't come from seeing someone
across the room who I thought was hot.

463
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,427
It came from...

464
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,429
really connecting with someone

465
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,140
on a deeper level
than I've ever experienced before.

466
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,601
Fuck.

467
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,781
Oh, my God.

468
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,497
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

469
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,916
Fuck.

470
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,418
That laugh.

471
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Fuck.

472
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,554
I wanted to do this in person.

473
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,182
Jessica...

474
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,266
Oh...

475
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,353
Will you marry me?

476
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,938
Yes.

477
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,858
Fuck.

478
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,443
Wow.

479
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,362
Did you see her?

480
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,030
Seriously, like...

481
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,658
holy shit!

482
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,827
Whoo! What?

483
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,119
That's my wife!

484
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,163
That's my wife.

485
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,915
Seeing you right now is...

486
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,210
the best feeling, I...

487
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,962
Is this the image you had in your head?

488
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,631
I don't even know what image
I had in my head.

489
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,301
- Hopefully...
- What was it?

490
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,386
- I don't... I couldn't tell you.
- This is better.

491
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,470
Yeah?

492
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,473
I asked someone earlier
what a 24-year-old looks like.

493
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,935
I didn't know, but you look like normal.

494
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,897
- You look like a grown-ass man.
- Yeah? Is it the beard?

495
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,191
- It's the beard. We'll keep that.
- Okay, phew.

496
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,110
I won't shave it down, I promise.

497
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,157
I wasn't sure with someone
that's much younger than me.

498
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,785
Would it be awkward?
And there was zero awkwardness.

499
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,664
It was just like finally being able to

500
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,501
see this person you've created the deepest
emotional bond of your life with.

501
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,588
Um, I was instantly...

502
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,591
very, very attracted to him.

503
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,013
<i>♪ This is your heart to break ♪</i>

<i>♪ This is your move to make ♪</i>

506
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,530
I'm looking forward
to getting married

507
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:41,534
and creating a family
that we can grow forever.

508
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,328
But I know when we walk out of here,

509
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,288
we're going to be met with
a lot of adversity.

510
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,166
I know friends and family
will have their opinions.

511
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,084
Hey, babe.

512
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,005
- Whoo!
- The person I love may not be

513
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:58,093
the stereotypical person
that people would choose for me,

514
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,846
but he's my person and I know his soul.

515
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,557
He is the most special person
I've ever met

516
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,019
and age is not a factor for us.

517
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,897
We're not worried about anything
that stands in our way.

518
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,482
Oh, my God.

519
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,236
Holy shit.

520
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,907
<i>♪ This is your move to make ♪</i>

522
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,220
In this blind love experiment,

523
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:46,224
six couples have fallen in love
and gotten engaged, sight unseen.

524
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,642
Hi!

525
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,063
How are you doing? Oh, my God.

526
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,442
Their weddings are just four weeks away.

527
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,503
Now, they've seen each other
for the very first time

528
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,404
and they've come to this tropical paradise

529
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,907
to help turn their emotional connection
into a physical one.

530
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,499
Up until now,
the only thing that's mattered

531
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,626
is who they are on the inside.

532
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,588
Now, their love will be put to the test.

533
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,508
Will their relationships flourish or fail

534
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,594
once they're exposed
to the physical realities

535
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,053
of the material world.

536
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,764
What the couples don't know,

537
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,087
is that they're all gonna be coming
to the same resort...

538
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,559
right here.

539
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,811
They started with love,

540
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,772
an emotional connection.

541
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,775
But... is love enough?

542
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,292
- Thank you.
- Gimme your purse.

543
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,045
Hold this.

544
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,964
It's cool because we're kind of working
like Benjamin Button.

545
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,467
You know, we're working backwards.

546
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:07,013
I know what he values and I've told him
my deepest fears, everything,

547
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,682
but I still have yet to explore him.

548
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,602
So, I'm excited
about our first night together.

549
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,399
I fell in love with my fiancée
without ever seeing her

550
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,694
and it's, it's, it's... weird.

551
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,655
It's different trying to establish

552
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,366
the emotional
and physical connection together.

553
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,993
When you have a really strong
emotional connection

554
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,037
and then you're bringing
the physical into it,

555
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,665
how do you get them to become one?

556
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,208
- Hmm? No?
- No.

557
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,835
- No?
- I don't know.

558
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,838
Mm.

559
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,632
- Mm-hmm.
- See?

560
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,675
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,759
<i>Perfecto.</i>

562
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,638

00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,390
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

564
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,225
- Oh.
- Oh.

565
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,726
- Oh, yeah?
- I was gonna dive in.

566
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,311
Ha ha! Cheers.

567
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,396
Cheers.

568
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,274
The Grand Velas Maya Rivera.

569
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,027
Stunning.

570
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,111
Mm.

571
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,445
It's a dream.

572
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,324
And I am here.

573
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,242
Obviously.

574
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,079
But I can't believe that I'm here.

575
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,707
I just don't want it to ever end.

576
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,083
It doesn't have to.

577
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,252
- No?
- It doesn't have to.

578
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,335
Okay.

579
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,005
What do you think of all this?

580
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,841
I feel like it's a...

581
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,927
fairy tale.

582
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,865
Something tells me
you've always wanted a fairy tale.

583
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,723
Yeah.

584
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:36,561
Well, it's just because I always grew up
watching movies and reading books

585
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,855
and they always described things like this

586
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,773
and it's always what I wanted

587
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,191
and the fact that I'm...

588
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,402
here...

589
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,240
Unreal, is what it is.

590
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,367
Definitely.

591
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,205
I can not be happier
to be here with anyone else.

592
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,545
You have touched me in more ways
than you can understand.

593
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,631
And...

594
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,216
I love you.

595
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,259
I really do.

596
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,809
I love you more.

597
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,688
Oh, you're gonna make me...

598
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,982
- Pull yourself together!
- I'm working on it.

599
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,526
You get me all emotional.

600
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,446
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,365
That truffle sauce...

602
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,368
- Is that what that is?
- You know what truffle is?

603
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,913
I've heard of chocolate truffles.

604
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,957
You're sexy.

605
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,878
So it's looking pretty romantic in there.

606
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,381
I'm just telling you, it's been 435 days.

607
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,385
435 days since what?

608
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,764
It's just been 435 days.

609
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,935
- Are you talking about...
- Yeah!

610
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,732
So you're talking about 435 days
without sex.

611
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,442
- Yeah.
- And you've counted.

612
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,781
Day 325, I went to the beach

613
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:15,576
so I can remember how it feels
to have my ass smacked, right?

614
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,870
- By the waves?
- Yeah, by the waves. Exactly.

615
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,123
'Cause it's been a while.

616
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,088
As I told you before, like...

617
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,090
I will move at your pace.

618
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,509
The sex is not... important.

619
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,262
But I do enjoy spending time
with you and getting to know you more.

620
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,471
I want it to be right.

621
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,433
I don't want it to be forced
just because we are engaged.

622
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,438
I just want to tear his clothes off.
I don't know.

623
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,481
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

624
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,151
Um...

625
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,195
But I'm just not hungry anymore.

626
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,453
- You're not hungry.
- Nope.

627
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,747
- I'm not.
- What about dessert?

628
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,416
I am dessert.

629
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,501
Oh.

630
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,794
This is good.

631
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,256
This is good.

632
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,675
I hope this isn't hers.

633
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,474
- Happy to be here with you.
- Mm-hmm.

634
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,060
- Me too. Same.
- And you're pretty, too.

635
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,519
- You're pretty.
- You're pretty.

636
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,520
Thank you.

637
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,604
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

638
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,109
I am so excited
for my first night with my fiancé.

639
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,779
Just to like, see him
and touch him and smell him

640
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,489
and just cuddle with him.

641
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,658
I do want to have sex with my fiancé,
but, like, not today.

642
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,869
I think we should take things slow.

643
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,748
I love talking to Kenny.
So I feel like we'll, like, stay up

644
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,336
and just talk to one another
and probably just share some kisses

645
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,506
and hold each other, 'cause that's
something we obviously didn't get to do,

646
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,882
up until recently.

647
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,176
Lounge on the... the sofa?

648
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,344
- Whoo!
- Yeah?

649
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,427
Yeah!

650
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,889
Our emotional connection is great.

651
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,975
Our physical attraction is super strong.

652
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:03,893
So, yeah.

653
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,355
I feel the sex will be,
actually, really good.

654
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,690
He's a really good kisser.

655
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,610
So, I think he has some talent...

656
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,738
elsewhere.

657
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,740
It's so good to see your face.

658
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:23,538
Like, to literally put like all the sounds
with the expressions now.

659
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,415
- Yeah.
- I can put my arm around you.

660
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,334
- I can put my arm around you.
- Yeah.

661
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,697
- We can count shoulders.
- Nice.

662
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,462
You ever counted shoulders?

663
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:35,550
- Counted shoulders?
- Yeah, you do one, two, three...

664
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,845
four.

665
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,974
I knew that I was going to accept whatever
she looked like

666
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,184
for exactly who she is.

667
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,311
And who I knew her to be in the pods.

668
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,607
Uh, but, yeah, I'm very much physically
attracted to Kelly.

669
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,236
She's the most wonderful person
that I've ever been around.

670
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,698
Her, you know, personality's infectious,
her laugh's infectious.

671
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,242
Uh, everything about her.
Even holding her hand.

672
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,494
Can I jump on the bed?

673
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,305
So you're already jumping on.

674
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,807
Shoes on and everything, huh?

675
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,208
Expectations for Kelly and I's
first night together

676
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,669
is probably a lot of kissing,

677
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,045
probably a lot of cuddling.

678
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,172
She's so pretty.

679
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,673
Mm. Thank you.

680
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,425
Mm-hmm. You're a pretty, girl.

681
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,509
Mm-hmm.

682
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,221
I'm not asking for kisses.

683
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,223
I know, but you want them.

684
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,683
But I'm a-lookin' for them.

685
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,392
Oh.

686
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,455
Mm.

687
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,791
Being engaged is awesome,

688
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,961
aside from the whole being terrified part.

689
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,049
But I'm definitely hoping
that the physical part with Cameron

690
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,468
matches up with our emotional connection.

691
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,888
This is so sexy this whole...

692
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,681
- Everything.
- ...shebang

693
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,807
Mm.

694
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,479
- Rose petals...
- Mm-hmm.

695
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,814
Hot tub.

696
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,065
You.

697
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,442
Me, you.

698
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,155
I can't think of anything else
that we need.

699
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,782
This is it.

700
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,534
I would love for this to work out
for Cameron and I

701
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:30,039
because he's everything I've ever wanted
in a husband and a father...

702
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,958
to my future children.

703
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,877
I've never felt like this with any man

704
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,297
and I think that we would have
a wonderful life together.

705
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,840
What more do we need?

706
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,804
I know.

707
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,015
- It's hard not to be a creep.
- I know.

708
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,743
- It's really hard.
- It's hard, I'm trying.

709
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,103
- 'Cause now, it's like, finally...
- Right.

710
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,605
I mean, it's just, you know...

711
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,566
It's just two people in love.
That's what happens.

712
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,650
Yeah.

713
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,487
Yeah, of course I'm excited
to be spending the night with Lauren.

714
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,740
You know, we've been
talking through walls, and...

715
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,744
we really haven't had that, that time to,

716
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,830
you know, be alone with each other.

717
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,873
We're definitely sizing each other up.

718
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:17,003
Yeah, I like what I see,
to put it very lightly.

719
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,631
This vacation's going to be
one to remember.

720
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,884
- Can I use your toothpaste?
- No.

721
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,968
Of course!

722
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,221
What's mine is yours.

723
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,390
Now we share.

724
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,185
You know, your chest hair is not that bad.

725
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,730
- No?
- I thought it was going to be worse.

726
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,133
You thought it was gonna be worse?
What were you expecting?

727
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,027
I just thought I was going to be like...

728
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,070
super, like...

729
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,238
I don't know, like...

730
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,741
bush.

731
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:53,289
I've never dated anyone that was white.

732
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,666
This is going to be, like,
a new experience for me.

733
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,252
And my thoughts are that he looks good.

734
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,589
Cameron is very sexy.
He's very attractive.

735
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,632
He has a little swag, so...

736
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,594
I definitely want to jump his bones.

737
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,304
Why is my mind in the gutter?

738
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,806
It's been way too long, y'all. Good lord!

739
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,641
I'm sorry, Mom and Dad. I'm sorry.

740
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,143
I'm an adult. I'm an adult.

741
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,647
Whee!

742
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:21,942
Mm.

743
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,198
And good night.

744
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,234
This is so beautiful.

745
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,539
Whoo!

746
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,250
Oh, shoot.

747
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,585
Here you go.

748
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,253
Yay.

749
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:46,008
I am super excited to be with my fiancé
on this romantic getaway,

750
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,596
And I'm so excited to make
a beautiful life together.

751
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,766
Mm. Could you imagine being
the strawberry dipper?

752
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,352
The things you say.

753
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,438
I just tend to say what comes
to mind first.

754
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,122
That's beautiful. I like that about you.

755
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,444
Hello, Mexican police?

756
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,447
- Come get this lady.
- Come get you!

757
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,740
- She's crazy.
- Bye-bye.

758
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,116
They wouldn't touch me.

759
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,662
I had to pick the craziest person
in the house.

760
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,372
You thought I was... I'm not crazy.

761
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,249
Yeah, you're crazy.
I knew that from day one.

762
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,209
- Why? Because I spoke my mind?
- Mm-hmm.

763
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,586
- That's normal, ain't it?
- Mm-mm.

764
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,465
You better be happy you pretty.

765
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,505
- I get away with stuff because I'm pretty?
- Mm-hmm.

766
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,552
Okay.

767
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,447
I would have been punched it
a long time ago.

768
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,723
- "Punched it"?
- Punched it. Like, "leave."

769
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,517
Okay. Hmm.

770
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,602
Watch your words here.

771
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,187
Come on. Chill out.

772
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:45,192
Carlton is definitely a different energy
than what we had in the pod.

773
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,988
I don't know if he's nervous
or if he's uncomfortable with something.

774
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,031
You make daddy feel good.

775
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,033
That's why you have that hat on.

776
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,536
You're not slick. Ooh!

777
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,037
You're not slick.

778
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,623
You want one that says "Mommy"?

779
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,209
When I am a mother,
I would love to have one.

780
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,919
I'm gonna get you one that says,

781
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,671
"Do not fucking touch."

782
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,007
No, I would not wear that.

783
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,091
Well...

784
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,970
What about one that says,
"Carlton's wife"?

785
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,262
Okay, I'll do that.

786
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,273
- You would?
- I would do that one,

787
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,892
If I'm your wife.

788
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,225
"If"?

789
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,549
I'm saying,
we still gotta walk down that aisle.

790
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,606
Oh, we're walking down that aisle.

791
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,232
- Okay.
- Ain't no turning back

792
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,318
- Ooh.
- What you gotta figure out?

793
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,778
We gotta move in together.
What do you mean?

794
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,783
I have a big secret to tell Diamond
about my sexuality

795
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,452
and I'm so nervous.

796
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,872
Every moment that I spend with her,
it's in the back of my head.

797
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,166
If I don't roll it out the right way,

798
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:47,838
it could just turn into a catastrophe
where she just can't deal with it.

799
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,381
I'm gonna get you a pogo stick

800
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,509
so you can hop out of your
feelings right now.

801
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,180
You know what?
You trying to start something.

802
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,472
Whatever.

803
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,184
All right,
so I'm just gonna go to the pool.

804
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,852
No, there is no pool.

805
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,271
I think this conversation's gonna get...
It's over.

806
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,023
Before it gets too deep.

807
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,706
This is our first night together.

808
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,422
I'm excited.
What number is it?

809
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:16,033
And I'm the happiest girl
in the world. This is us right here.

810
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,243
Ah!

811
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,244
- Yay.
- You ready?

812
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,367
This is the first night
outside of the pod

813
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,374
and it's freaking me out
that I'm engaged right now.

814
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,959
Did I really just do this?

815
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,461
My parents don't know
what's going on right now.

816
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:31,215
I don't have my phone
so no one knows where I am.

817
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,259
No one knows I'm in Mexico.

818
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,176
It's...

819
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,220
It's crazy and it's tripping me out.

820
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,056
I love hearing the waves crashing
on the beach.

821
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,642
That's my favorite thing
in the whole world.

822
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,814
- I'm thankful.
- Me too.

823
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,731
I love you.

824
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,193
I've always been a very sexual
and romantic and passionate person,

825
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,363
but I have always been missing
that emotional connection.

826
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,615
I believe that now
that I've finally developed

827
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,951
that emotional connection before that,

828
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,912
I think that Jessica and I can really
turn it into...

829
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,290
It's going to feel as though I'm a virgin.

830
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,835
Experiencing something for the first time
with brand new eyes

831
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,338
in a first experience
and I'm excited for it.

832
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,591
Ah! This shirt.

833
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,760
- Love it, love it, love it.
- I'm gonna go shirtless.

834
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,513
- You're going shirtless?
- Yep, going shirtless.

835
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,433
The person I fell in love with
was a voice.

836
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,476
And now here he is in the flesh.

837
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,477
This is him,

838
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:29,815
and I'm struggling a little bit,
so far, in just...

839
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,859
meshing the two people.

840
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,944
We're about to get
extra friendly here.

841
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,573
All right.

842
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,450
I would say he's not the typical...

843
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,660
guy that I would go for.

844
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,370
My normal type is...

845
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,789
usually a bigger guy.

846
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Um...

847
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,168
Just a bigger guy.

848
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,420
So...

849
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,672
in this experience,

850
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:58,552
like, I really feel like people
can kinda jump in very quickly,

851
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:02,556
get into a sexual relationship
and then things don't go well...

852
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,100
and it can be very, very painful.

853
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:09,188
So my preference is
that we don't go there.

854
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:15,110
My whole thing is I would never force you
to do anything you don't want to do.

855
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,111
It's me and you.

856
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,239
We started this whole thing just,
again, talking.

857
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,742
I want to get to know you more.
I want you to be you.

858
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,827
I don't want this to be something
that it's not.

859
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,623
The whole reason we're here is
because we took a leap of faith.

860
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,000
- And because of that leap of faith...
- Agreed.

861
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,877
I think, you know...

862
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:36,215
Whatever I think we both agree on,
yeah, we make it work.

863
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,050
I'm not ready to just,
you know...

864
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,345
jump on him or anything like that,
but I'm kind of excited

865
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,806
because I think part
of this whole experiment is

866
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,934
we've got an emotional bond,
it's not someone I would typically go for

867
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,395
based on looks,
so let's see if we can build off that

868
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,106
and see if that attraction can really grow

869
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:57,152
and that we can be as deeply seeded
together physically as we are emotionally.

870
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:09,914
Hey.

871
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,127
Oh.

872
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,633
I don't know.
You might have drank all my champagne.

873
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,634
It's okay.

874
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,885
Just bring the bottle.

875
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,097
Perfect. Yes.

876
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,684
This is our first night
alone together

877
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:34,523
and there is a little bit of awkwardness
because you know this person

878
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,151
but physically, their body,
their appearance...

879
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,944
Seeing them is totally new to you.

880
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:43,699
But, that connection,
that fire is just as strong-

881
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,243
as it ever was through a wall.

882
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,078
My fiancé is<i> fine.</i>

883
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,246
Oh!

884
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,666
I'm gonna have such pretty babies, y'all.

885
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,719
You're just going to drink
out of the bottle?

886
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,671
It's what I do.

887
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,548
Like a champ.

888
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,468
- That's my fiancé.
- Yep.

889
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,095
I definitely feel like Amber's
the right girl for me.

890
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:09,516
And I feel like our physical
relationship is increasing...

891
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,351
our emotional connection.

892
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,687
So, if things happen, they happen,

893
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,940
and I'm not expecting anything,
but we'll see.

894
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,736
- Pretty ring, who got it for you?
- I don't know, some guy.

895
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,823
Some weirdo proposed to me through a wall.
I guess I said yes.

896
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,075
Man, I'm wearing
an engagement ring, too,

897
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,702
- and it's a man version.
- Oh!

898
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,273
If it gets warm, I'm sorry.

899
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,546
Don't you dare!

900
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,715
You're nasty!

901
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,763
I know you.

902
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,099
I can tell when something's upsetting you
and I'm like,

903
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,893
is everything okay?

904
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,648
It's just that feeling, that energy,
I have with you.

905
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,860
I've never seen this side of Carlton
and it really hurts me.

906
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,613
I'm so confused, I don't understand,

907
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,824
it's just so many feelings
are running through me

908
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,326
that I don't even know where to start.

909
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,410
You okay?

910
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,750
- What's on your mind?
- A lot.

911
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,002
With you, I feel like...

912
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,214
I can be myself completely

913
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:26,510
and I feel like you know when something
is off.

914
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,303
Like, you can sense it.

915
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,558
Like, I really love you,
but it's like certain things

916
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,685
are, like, always in the back of my head.

917
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,061
Certain things like what?

918
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,189
Like the past.

919
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,695
I feel like there was
no possible way you could...

920
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,446
Like, a woman like you...

921
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,867
as perfect as you are,
as beautiful as you are...

922
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:52,869
Aww...

923
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,417
Hey.

924
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,715
What's wrong?

925
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:08,093
It's just stuff that we have
to just discuss because...

926
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,013
I feel like...

927
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,893
I've always been in situations where
people have abandoned me

928
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,352
and have, like, rejected me.

929
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,024
First off, you don't have nothing
to worry about.

930
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,859
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't.

931
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,278
I do. I have a lot to worry about.

932
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,906
- You have no idea. You have no idea.
- In regards of me.

933
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,074
You could leave me at any moment,

934
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:32,825
because...

935
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,537
I haven't fully opened up.

936
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,416
What...

937
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,793
What is it that you want
to open up to me about?

938
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,463
I don't feel like you're going to want me
after this information.

939
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,423
What information?

940
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:50,928
In the past...

941
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,599
I have dated both genders.

942
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,523
What do you mean? Like male and female?

943
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,567
Male and female, yeah.

944
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,701
It's a lot to accept.
I get it. It's okay.

945
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,495
Like, I have my fears. I have...

946
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,914
I have gone through the thought of...

947
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,751
Fuck, you met the love
of your fucking life and now...

948
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:31,093
My question is, how do you know
I'm the love of your life?

949
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,845
Do you ever feel
like you need to go date...

950
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,682
- No. No.
- ...another man?

951
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,849
No.

952
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,186
That is the biggest misconception
in the world.

953
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:46,358
The biggest misconception in the world
for men like me, who are honest,

954
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,193
I love...

955
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,487
people for who they are...

956
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,655
at the core.

957
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,410
This has nothing to do with it.

958
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,413
This has nothing to do with it.

959
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,499
Like, that has never been
the motivating force in my life.

960
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,084
It's a lot to accept.

961
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,668
Yeah.

962
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,566
Like, I'm looking at you right now and...

963
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,760
- I'm listening.
- I feel like your eyes are so blank.

00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,431
- It's a lot to take in.
- I know. I know.

965
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,435
Fuck!

We were literally
four weeks away from our wedding.

969
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:45,333
Like, I love Carlton,
but I was not prepared for that.

970
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,417
I...

971
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,796
may leave this earth alone,

972
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,674
but I will leave this earth saying
I was fucking honest.

973
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,843
I didn't fucking deceive nobody

974
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,846
and I did one of the hardest
fucking things that was ever done.

975
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,015
I'm not a hider. What am I hiding for?

976
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,267
Why can I not be myself?

977
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,977
You can be yourself.

978
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,854
You can be yourself.

00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,440
I just... I just need time...

980
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,568
to think about this.

981
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,279
It's... I mean,
you just threw a curveball.

982
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:15,946
I know.

983
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,000
I'm going to...

984
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,668
- Go, just go.
- See you later.
