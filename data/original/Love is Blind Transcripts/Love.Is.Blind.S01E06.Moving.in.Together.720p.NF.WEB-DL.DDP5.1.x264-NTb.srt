1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,218
Damian Powers, will you marry me?

2
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,386
I will marry you.

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,761
Will you marry me?

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,765
I will marry you. I will be your wife.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,935
<i>I'm engaged to someone
who I've never seen!</i>

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,520
You're such a beautiful person.

7
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,272
I don't have to see you to say that.

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,149
Ho ho!

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,317
Yeah.

10
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,361
How you doing?

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:42,250
I've never had a man so willing to show me
how much he loves me.

12
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,170
You know when people, like,
name stars?

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,922
- I want that.
- Well, we will find a star,

14
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,216
and we will name it after you.

15
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,637
Gentlemen, meet the ladies
that you did <i>not</i> propose to.

16
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,266
Seeing Barnett and Mark,

17
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,311
who would you say
that you're more attracted to?

18
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,729
You know, I would take Barnett.

19
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,232
I know I don't want to go meet your family
with a ring on my finger.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,280
There's nothing I don't like about you.
Nothing.

21
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,998
<i>♪ Ooh baby come a little closer ♪</i>

22
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,918
<i>♪ I won't bite when I get to know you ♪</i>

23
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,089
<i>♪ Something I can't deny
I'm lost in your eyes ♪</i>

24
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,131
I like it.

25
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,975
- A catamaran.
- I like it.

26
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,885
Come on back.

27
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,761
All right.

28
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,184
So how's everybody feeling about,
sort of, like, you know,

29
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,770
vacation wrapping up
and, like, us heading back into,

30
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,231
- you know, move-in day?
- So ready.

31
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,315
Ready to be back.

32
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,484
And I've loved this entire experience,
it's just...

33
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,904
seeing the rest of everything,
the reality.

34
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,757
The reality of everything come together,
and...

35
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,967
I'm so torn because, like, I want to stay
in the bubble,

36
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,284
and I like the "just us" thing.

37
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,995
But also I'm super excited to get to,
like, introduce him

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,164
- to everybody back home and share.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,999
I do think some of the couples...

40
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,169
They're more in their heads
instead of their hearts.

41
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,215
They're not really embracing what
they're feeling, because it scares them.

42
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,803
So I don't really know if everybody is
honestly going to...

43
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,265
make it to that "I do,"

44
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,101
but I know Barnett and I will.

45
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,270
Oh, wow, I just had mad déjà vu.

46
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,473
- Wow.
- That's deep.

47
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,522
Okay.

48
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,732
Oh, my God, we were meant to be here,
you guys.

49
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,234
I've been dreaming about y'all.

50
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,820
It is weird how familiar everyone seems.

51
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,488
It's crazy.

52
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,700
It's amazing how Cameron's still
so calm through this whole process.

53
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:42,495
Cameron's just like, "this is amazing."

54
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,414
That's just... That's just me, y'all.

55
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,897
- This breeze is amazing right now.
- It is!

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,751
This is what we were waiting for.

57
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,211
The calm before the storm.

58
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,546
You know what?

59
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,339
Storm's a-brewin', guys.

60
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,258
Storm's a-brewin'.

61
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,964
Welcome, everyone. Good morning.

62
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,396
Hope you've enjoyed
your romantic getaway.

63
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,648
Lauren and Cameron,

64
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,234
Gigi and Damian,

65
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,403
Kenny and Kelly,

66
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,198
Amber, Barnett,

67
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,575
Mark, Jessica...

68
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,536
In this blind love experiment,

69
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,830
you guys chose each other.

70
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,790
You fell in love,

71
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,879
and then you got engaged to the person
who is now your fiancé,

72
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,465
before ever seeing one another.

73
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,511
You've had an amazing opportunity here
to begin to grow your emotional connection

74
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,889
into a physical one.

75
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,390
Yo.

76
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,935
I'm guessing some of you had more fun
with that than others.

77
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,765
Not naming names. No names.

78
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,493
I don't know what y'all are talking about.

79
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,151
Now it's time for you to leave
this paradise

80
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,819
and start building your lives together.

81
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,657
Each of you will move into a new home:

82
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,495
A neutral space for you guys
to deepen your relationships.

83
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,917
But it's so important that you continue to
support each other when you go back home.

84
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,630
No one else on the planet understands
what you ten are going through.

85
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,342
And now you guys will have
a support system that's very, very close.

86
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,779
- Like, next door.
- How close?

87
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,263
How close are we talking?

88
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,973
We all dated, guys.

89
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,976
Let's not go there.

90
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,938
Each couple is going to be moving
into the same complex.

91
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,650
Meet your new neighbors.

92
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,443
How thick are the walls?

93
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,280
Oh, my God.

94
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,449
Lauren, is that a good "Oh, my God?"

95
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,533
I don't know yet.

96
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,995
- Bunch of misfits.
- I know.

97
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,957
In this physical world, your love is going
to be put to the test.

98
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,751
You're going to face so many challenges.

99
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,130
How are you guys going to
integrate your lives?

100
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,717
Your friends, your families,
your careers, your homes.

101
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,428
You'll get your phones and devices back.

102
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,263
Ooh!

103
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,974
Your weddings are just three weeks away.

104
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:08,891
Ooh!

105
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,184
- Okay.
- Yeah.

106
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,230
In the pods, you guys all built
an amazing foundation.

107
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,233
And if you make it through these tests,

108
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,863
I promise your marriage is going to
move forward on extremely solid ground,

109
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,781
a ground that you've built.

110
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,951
It's as strong as, or stronger than,
any marriage ever.

111
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,664
We're giving you the absolute
best chance for lifetime success.

112
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,002
But will you allow the opinion
of family and friends,

113
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,795
the allure of other people,

114
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,257
the distractions of social media,
to sabotage your wedding?

115
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,759
Sabotage your happiness?

116
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,845
This is all part of the experiment.

117
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,683
Will you judge one another
for your looks, your race,

118
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,478
your age, your family,
or your circumstance?

119
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,272
Will any of that really matter?

120
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,649
Or will love be enough?

121
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,028
Is who you are on the inside enough?

122
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,655
Are<i> you</i> enough?

123
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,954
Ultimately, in front of your family
and your friends, you're going to decide.

124
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,625
Will you say "I do" to the person
you chose sight unseen?

125
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,629
Or are you going to walk away
from them forever?

126
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,468
Is love blind?

127
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,304
We hope that <i>you</i> prove it is.

128
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,474
Everybody, have a safe trip home.

129
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,101
Best of luck with your wedding plans.

130
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,204
- Yes, we'll see you guys back home.
- See you soon.

131
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,729
- Take care.
- Safe travels.

132
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,333
Good luck planning the weddings.
See you guys. Safe trip.

133
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,150
- Yes!
- Cheers!

134
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,615
No, but it's been fun. I mean,

135
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,410
getting to know you and see you every day

136
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,493
and hold you, and...

137
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,473
Not that I won't be able to do that, but,
you know...

138
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,458
It's just different when
there's no other distractions.

139
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,421
Social media and phones and all that stuff
you know, it's just different, so...

140
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,382
Going back into the real world,
we're going to have distractions.

141
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,428
I think one of the biggest challenges
is social media.

142
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,889
There's images of girls, images of guys.

143
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,253
We've talked about this.

144
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,518
You know, you have full access to...

145
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,981
you know, see who's texting
or direct messaging me.

146
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:20,982
I mean, it's not...

147
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,109
- I don't have anything to hide.
- Right.

148
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,778
Um, I think I left something downstairs.

149
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,656
I bet you did.

150
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,700
Am I nervous about the outside world?

151
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,161
I'm not nervous, I'm curious.

152
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,954
'Cause things are gonna change.

153
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,165
But how? We'll see.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,587
You think they'd be mad if we just, like,
sort of stowed away in here?

155
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,230
This isn't a boat.
I don't think that's how this works.

156
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,385
We're sad to be leaving,

157
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,805
but we are excited
to start our lives together.

158
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,266
Let's get outta here.

159
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,935
- Step by step.
- Yep. Day by day.

160
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,645
Let's do it.

161
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,154
- We just got home.
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,615
And guess who is heading on a trip.

163
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,241
This one.

164
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,325
It's all right.

165
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,369
I have to go to San Diego for two days.

166
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,916
Which means that I'm not gonna see him
after seeing him now.

167
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,212
- Be safe, I love you
- Aw.

168
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,463
I'll call you later.

169
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,341
<i>You met the man of your dreams?</i>

170
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,824
- Yes.
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

171
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,718
Hey!

172
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,762
- Say hi!
- Hi, this is Mark.

173
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,180
<i>Hi, Mark.</i>

174
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:38,476
There's something about just landing
at home and getting back to normal life.

175
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,480
I got my phone back,
and the first person I call is my mom.

176
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,275
I've never gone that long without
checking in with my mom ever before.

177
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,696
So, it was just a sigh of relief
that I let her know what's going on.

178
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,698
I've come back with a fiancé.

179
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,992
She's told me that she can make
Italian beef for me,

180
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,804
- so I was like, all right, that's it.
<i>- That's awesome.</i>

181
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,828
That's it.

182
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,174
Welcome home, guys.

183
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,552
Aww. Thanks, guys.

184
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,262
Ready to see our new home?

185
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,472
- Yes, let's do it.
- Let's do it.

186
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,976
This is our first night together,
in our new place together.

187
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,244
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

188
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,524
I love it.

189
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,818
Oh, man. Bedroom.

190
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,446
Cool. Cute. Cute.

191
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,073
The wedding is in three weeks,

192
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,784
and on the inside
I'm freaking the fuck out, okay?

193
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,122
"A," because I think that planning
our wedding is going to be stressful.

194
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:45,334
"B," I'm anxious just kind of about
sharing space in general,

195
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,712
because I have been alone for a long time.

196
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,965
That sounds bad, but it's the truth.
It's my truth, I own it.

197
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,901
- I'm ready to eat.
- Me, too.

198
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,261
I just have to keep reminding myself,
like...

199
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,849
"You love Cameron, this is going to
be great, it's going to be beautiful."

200
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,392
And so I just think

201
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,145
that the next couple weeks are going to be
hella stressful.

202
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,189
You know...

203
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,649
What's up?

204
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,569
I feel like I'm crunching so loud, like...

205
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,408
And it's funny, because one of my
pet peeves is when I can hear people chew.

206
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,658
Yeah?

207
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,661
What are your other pet peeves?

208
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,164
I'm a clean person,
so I don't like clutter.

209
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,833
And I feel like if you use a dish, like,
just wash it.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,210
Um, what else?

211
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,088
Oh, put the toilet seat down, please.

212
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,548
Because if I fall in the toilet...

213
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,593
...I will not speak to you.

214
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,219
Even though I love you,

215
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,181
don't use my toothbrush.

216
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,349
Some people do that.

217
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,599
Do you do that?

218
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,495
I wouldn't have a problem with it,
but I'm not gonna do it.

219
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,022
Oh, my God, honey. What?

220
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,232
That would really bother you?

221
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,193
- You using my toothbrush?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,528
- Are you for real?
- I mean, just...

223
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,656
Have you shared a toothbrush
with someone before?

224
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,241
Have I done it before?
Yes, I've done it before.

225
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,242
Oh, my God.

226
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,870
As a married woman, I am willing to share

227
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,331
a lot of things with my husband.

228
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,959
We can share food, we can share a bed,

229
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,836
we can share a pillow.

230
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
But I'll be damned

231
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,383
if we are sharing a toothbrush, Cameron.

232
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,884
That is nasty.

233
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,386
That is nasty.

234
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,013
Nasty! No.

235
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,349
It's just, I can't. I can't do that.

236
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,267
I just can't believe he even said that.

237
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,270
Unbelievable. No way. Mm-mm.

238
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,354
But I love you.

239
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,025
But not that much.
No, I'm kidding.

240
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,528
- Wow.
- I'm joking, I'm joking.

241
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,238
What's some of your pet peeves?

242
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,989
Not being able to use your toothbrush.

243
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,908
Oh, my God.

244
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,122
- This is pork.
- I cannot wait to tell my mom

245
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,039
that we're engaged.

246
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,249
She's going to freak out.

247
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,917
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
Like, everything's
going to go into hyperdrive

249
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,338
because the wedding is in three weeks.

250
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,424
- Geez Louise.
- Three weeks.

251
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,008
- Three weeks.
- Are you gonna...

252
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,260
Are you scared yet?

253
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,471
- It'll hit me.
- So...

254
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,475
In case you try to run, you should know
that I put a tracker in your ring.

255
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,773
- I mostly promise.
- I'm... I'm nervous.

256
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,525
Oh, God, I'm so ready to eat.

257
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,254
Are you excited
to tell your mom?

258
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,279
Mm-hmm.

259
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,824
I'm nervous to tell my family.

260
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,324
Why?

261
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,441
They're gonna think I'm insane.

262
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,273
I think my mom's gonna be excited

263
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,206
because she thinks
I'm going to settle down.

264
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,666
Joke's on her.

265
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,418
- You're as weird as I am.
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,088
I think it would be hard for somebody

267
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,840
that hasn't lived through this

268
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,677
to understand how serious it is,

269
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,680
and how legitimate these feelings are.

270
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,515
If you've never lived it,

271
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,476
you'll never understand it.

272
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,354
You complete me.

273
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,197
I don't typically unpack the day of.

274
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,908
Today you do.

275
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,077
Considered you're an organized mess,
I'm going to make you organized.

276
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,621
Without the mess.

277
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,915
There's a lot in there.

278
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,626
I have a feeling, like,
there's more coming.

279
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,381
Well, moving in with Damian
is going to be another adventure.

280
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,841
We're going to be here forever.

281
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,177
I brought a lot of unnecessary things,
maybe.

282
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,262
But you always have to be prepared.

283
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,681
So, I dress in my mood,
That's how you know.

284
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,785
That's why
you have so many different outfits.

285
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,851
- Yes.
- Oh.

286
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,732
God, Giannina.

287
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,110
Look at that, see?
That didn't take too long.

288
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,823
Three more suitcases to go.

289
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,329
What's going on?

290
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,331
<i>- Hey, babe!
- </i>Hey!

291
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,460
It feels a little weird to be here
without Kelly in the apartment.

292
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,170
You, uh, you make it on time?

293
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>Yeah, I'm about to start
the conference.</i>

294
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,801
<i>I'm glad we have the opportunity to talk
for a second,</i>

295
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,094
<i>and for me to see your face.</i>

296
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,762
Oh, heck, yeah. Heck, yeah.

297
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,474
Being alone tonight for the first time
in five days,

298
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,017
it'll be a little strange.

299
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,352
You know, I'll miss Kelly.

300
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,563
Knowing that she was, you know,
there next to me

301
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,648
definitely brought a sense of comfort.

302
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,526
I'm sure that it's going to be tough
for her to fall asleep

303
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,237
in San Diego on this, you know, work trip.

304
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,781
All right, babe.
Well, I will let you scoot,

305
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,078
and I'm going to get back
to eating some dinner.

306
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,158
- Okay.
<i>- Sounds good.</i>

307
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,704
- All right, babe. I love you.
- <i>I love you too.</i>

308
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,497
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

309
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,165
- To a new home.
- To a new home.

310
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,334
Now that we're back in Atlanta,

311
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,129
I'm just looking forward to having
somebody at the end of the day.

312
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:44,049
When I get back from a trip,
being able to come home to him and laugh.

313
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,594
You know, as you can see,
we have a lot of fun.

314
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,388
So that's something that I've been missing
for a long time.

315
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:53,058
I'm hoping that that can really
reignite my passion

316
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:57,605
and hopefully set off this
other physical piece of our relationship

317
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,273
that I have been trying to,

318
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,357
you know, fill.

319
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,943
We have a very small bed here.

320
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,821
Much smaller than anything I'm used to,

321
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,325
and I don't feel uncomfortable,
kind of crawling in here with him,

322
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,119
so I think that's a step
in the right direction.

323
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,414
- So I noticed you got your ring back on.
- I did.

324
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,549
I signed up for this experiment.
I want to be in it fully.

325
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,468
So I put back on the ring

326
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,428
and I'm here,
and I want to be present in this.

327
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,601
I'm opening my heart up to
this whole experience, so...

328
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,313
It feels awesome to see

329
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,899
kind of like a switch
turn for the better,

330
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,944
and I'm excited to see
where the rest of this journey goes.

331
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:49,531
I think what's really important is getting
back to what got us here at this point,

332
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,326
is being able to communicate.

333
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,538
And it's one of those serious things
that is...

334
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,333
If I'm going to the bathroom
on a double flusher...

335
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,211
No, she didn't.

336
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,545
What?

337
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,215
Seriously. That takes a long time.

338
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,846
Well, you know what? By all means.

339
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,891
I proposed to someone I didn't see.
By all means, we're on this level.

340
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,644
- We never talked about poop.
- Never talked about poop.

341
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,706
- That would've been the deal sealer.
- Would it have been?

342
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,210
You should have started with day one.

343
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,025
You don't want someone who's constipated.

344
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,486
If you would've said...
No, if you would have said...

345
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,131
- They'll be pissed off.
- ..."I'm a double flusher kind of girl,"

346
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,449
then I would have been like,
"You know what? I got you."

347
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,827
Mark, everyone poops.

348
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,538
Okay, so this is the serious question
I have, though.

349
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,791
- Because if you want to get real close...
- Yeah?

350
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:45,129
...are you comfortable being in there
while Mount Vesuvius is erupting?

351
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,812
I will hold my breath.
But as long as I can brush my teeth, and...

352
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,758
- That's love!
- As long as I can go like this

353
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,011
- and brush my teeth...
- That's love.

354
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,355
Looks like we're officially
all moved in, honey.

355
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,315
- I know.
- It's like the...

356
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,568
honeymoon is over.

357
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,820
But the honeymoon phase is still going on.

358
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,924
- It still feels pretty good to me.
- I still feel like I'm floating.

359
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,825
Now that we're going back
into the real world,

360
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,454
I'm sure that we'll have a lot of hurdles
and obstacles to overcome.

361
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,748
Parents and friends and their opinions.

362
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,001
I mean, even the fact that we are
an interracial couple.

363
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,005
But I love Cameron for who he is
on the inside.

364
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,174
You know, that's what I fell in love with.

365
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,384
And if we get married, I think that

366
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,344
we would have a wonderful life together.

367
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,144
Whoop!

368
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,585
You're so romantic.
I love it. Mm.

369
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,266
I don't know why I'm, like,
nervous for you to see my place now.

370
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,019
You are...

371
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,270
I am who I am.

372
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,984
So today we're going back to
our own respective homes...

373
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,196
- This is my block.
- Okay.

374
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,366
Here we go. My place.

375
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:42,121
...to pack up what we need
to live together up until the wedding.

376
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,039
Here we go.

377
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,375
This is the dollhouse.

378
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,128
- Beautiful.
- It's small, but you know.

379
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,879
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

380
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,798
Good things come in small packages,
they say.

381
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,676
Right, right? So this is <i>mi casa.</i>

382
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,554
- Let me give you a little <i>Cribs </i>tour.
- Please.

383
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,182
Uh, this is my studio.

384
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,227
My place is definitely my sanctuary.

385
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,272
Even though it's small, I've really made
it my own.

386
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,690
I'm a bit of a loner,

387
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,234
so I guess I'm just protective over it
in a lot of ways,

388
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,737
and I was just hoping that I didn't leave
anything out that I forgot to put up.

389
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,532
I like to make vision boards.

390
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,201
- Oh, this is kind of like Mexico.
- Right.

391
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,454
- Oh, wow.
- It's kind of crazy how similar that is.

392
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,016
- Yeah, that's awesome.
- We had rose petals in our little pool.

393
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,125
Wow, we did.

394
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,501
Aww, this, too.

395
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,045
- I'm seeing the beach and... kayak.
- Yeah, Mexico.

396
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,423
Where? Oh, yeah.

397
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,093
I was a little nervous
about Cameron seeing my messy

398
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,053
"throw everything in there" closet.

399
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,182
Um... Grab those.

400
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,017
But he didn't judge me, so it's okay.

401
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,102
Let me get my camera stuff.

402
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,520
Do you want this as well?

403
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,022
- No, I don't need that.
- Okay.

404
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,440
Thank you, though.

405
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,949
Mark loves me unconditionally,

406
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,994
but I don't want to be naïve
to the fact that

407
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,039
some people are not going to be happy
if we get married.

408
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:12,628
I don't want us to be super disappointed
when the real world smacks us in the face

409
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,129
and doesn't accept us.

410
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,132
Oh, my God!
Brown on brown on brown on brown?

411
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,301
I've never seen this many shades of brown,
actually.

412
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,260
I swear to God.

413
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,447
I don't ever use these shades of brown.
It's kind of funny.

414
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,348
How now brown cow?

415
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,265
God!

416
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,644
Is this a beanbag chair?
I haven't had one of these in a while.

417
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,188
Don't do it.

418
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,271
Why?

419
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,731
It's cozy.

420
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,734
Look at all your gaming systems.

421
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,778
My little brother would dig this setup.

422
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,484
- Do you need your college history book?
- No, it's my personal training book.

423
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,532
Okay.

424
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,497
Sorry.

425
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,750
Let's sit down so he can
fill us in on what's happening.

426
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,063
He lives with his best friend
and his best friend's girlfriend. So...

427
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,673
God bless him.
I could never have roommates again.

428
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,009
I have thought a ton about
what our friends and what our family

429
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,095
will say about our age difference,

430
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:08,058
and I keep reminding him that
that is going to affect our relationship.

431
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:12,104
He's really strong-willed about the fact

432
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,022
that we can get through anything,

433
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,775
and I want to believe in that,

434
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,360
but I'm also realistic.

435
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,861
How's it's been without me?

436
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,698
Uh, well, we have food in the pantry
and in the fridge.

437
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,134
<i>- </i>So that's always a plus.
- We bought groceries once a week.

438
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,160
- Yeah, uh...
- Well...

439
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,540
I told her, I was like,
literally our house is based on sarcasm.

440
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,751
It's like the second you walk in
and you mess up even a little bit...

441
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,435
- Even a stutter...
- We're all over you.

442
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,541
- We're all over it.
- You gotta be on your best game

443
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,674
every single time you're in this house.

444
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,397
I mean, you come here, you come prepared.

445
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,928
Alright, alright. I like it.

446
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,140
The cool thing about Mark, something
I've always admired about him...

447
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,600
is he gives 110%

448
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,645
to whatever he sees
and he puts his mind on.

449
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,064
Anything he does, he does real well.

450
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,442
But the problem is,
the things he doesn't want to do,

451
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,485
Jesus couldn't convince him to do it.

452
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,672
He is not gonna do it.

453
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,281
- Like what?
- Like the dishes.

454
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,616
- He does not like to do dishes.
- What?

455
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,952
- That's not true. That is not true.
- Oh, really?

456
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,203
That is not true.

457
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,247
I picked up your dishes this morning.

458
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,416
- Night one in the apartment.
- What?

459
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,419
Any dish that will fit in a dishwasher,

460
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,754
he'll load it in there.

461
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,131
But if it's too big,
forget about him hand-washing it.

462
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,217
- All right, I'm making notes over here.
- Yeah.

463
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,969
And I'm drinking.

464
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,138
Well, Mom folded some laundry for you.

465
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,221
It's in your room.

466
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,904
She did your laundry while you were gone.

467
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,851
- That's amazing.
- My heart.

468
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,936
I hope you're also taking notes of this.

469
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,563
Laundry. You know...

470
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,149
I work 70 hours a week.
We've had this discussion.

471
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,513
- I don't do laundry.
- Mark, you're gonna do the laundry.

472
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,612
No, I will never do his laundry.

473
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,681
I will never do his laundry.
I don't even do my own laundry.

474
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,785
I'm happy to I take
his laundry to wash-and-fold.

475
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,954
So we aired all his dirty laundry.
Tell us about yourself.

476
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,832
I work for a technology company
and I travel quite a bit,

477
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,356
that's one thing we've talked about.

478
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,128
Our jobs are totally different,
our lives are totally different.

479
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,090
I've got a golden retriever
and a house in Peachtree Hills.

480
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,050
So, yeah.

481
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,384
That's awesome.

482
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,428
So I'm curious.

483
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,473
I gotta know.
What did Mark tell you to pick him?

484
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,433
Um...

485
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,812
I've always been kind of scared
of commitment

486
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,939
because I felt like it was never
the right person.

487
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,692
You know, but with him,
just something clicked.

488
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,196
And it was because
we created an emotional relationship.

489
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,156
In three weeks we're getting married.

490
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,075
- That's fast.
- You know...

491
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,159
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

492
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,454
And for right now, I can see...

493
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,642
I felt like these guys
didn't judge us at all.

494
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,668
They didn't ask anything about the age.

495
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,253
So I really liked that.

496
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,673
And, you know, Mark's told me to trust him
about that this entire time,

497
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,217
and now I feel very at ease
about the situation.

498
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,135
But I'm...

499
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,114
- You put me in an awkward predicament.
- You've got big competition around here.

500
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,764
- Wow.
- He did pretty good.

501
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,225
- I picked a pretty good one, so...
- Nice.

502
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,310
Picked a pretty good one.

503
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,603
But yeah, no, it's...

504
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,147
I don't know. Excited about it.

505
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,314
That's awesome.

506
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,901
I've put my ring back on
because I want to be all in.

507
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,987
It was nice meeting you, Jessica.

508
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,321
Good luck to you guys.

509
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,005
Right now I feel really great wearing it

510
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,033
and seeing if this thing
will work out for us.

511
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,327
This was a huge day for us.

512
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,121
- Love y'all.
- See you later.

513
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,664
- Bye.
- All right.

514
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,396
It's quite large, sir.

515
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,970
It's very nice, though.
Very Southern.

516
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,931
When I bought this three bedroom home,

517
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,518
I had my hopes on the idea

518
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,895
that I would have a wife,

519
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,855
and I could start a family with her.

520
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,231
So...

521
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,984
Now having Lauren in my life,

522
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,738
you know, I might try and plant some seeds
in her mind while she's there.

523
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,240
Oh, wow.

524
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,160
This is really nice, Cameron.
- Yes.

525
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,954
I love the wood floors. And the fireplace.

526
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,038
Right.

527
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,418
- Oh, wow. Everything's like new, too.
- Yeah.

528
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,046
Well, you show...
I don't just want to walk around.

529
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,048
- You show me.
- Oh, no, please. I mean...

530
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:11,301
- This is your place.
- Well, it could be our place pretty soon.

531
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,594
- Could be.
- Yes.

532
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,223
- This is nice, I want to explore.
- Okay.

533
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,520
- The master.
- Here we go.

534
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,855
It's freaking big, Cameron, for just you.

535
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,567
- Hopefully not for too long.
- You must have anticipated, um...

536
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,570
- Mm-hmm?
- ...having someone else very soon.

537
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,074
- It took a while
- It's beautiful.

538
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,409
Ooh!

539
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Wow.

540
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,248
This reminds me of, like,
the frat houses in college.

541
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,499
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

542
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,001
A lot of them had,
like, the balconies like this.

543
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,085
Right.

544
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:51,716
This home is beautiful.
You have plenty of space for me in here.

545
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,343
It's so crazy, like, just...

546
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,098
Like, seeing this and thinking
about the future,

547
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,433
and, like,
"Oh, this could be a kid's room."

548
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,603
You know,
I'm so happy to hear Lauren say

549
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,813
that she could think

550
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,731
of the empty room in my house

551
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,941
as a kid's room.

552
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,651
I was originally thinking

553
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,611
it could be an office space for her,

554
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,154
and it still could be, but...

555
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,365
Crazy as it sounds,

556
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,700
I'm, I'm...

557
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,911
I'm ready to have children with her

558
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,454
in not that much time.

559
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,291
I mean, we want to enjoy being husband
and wife...

560
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,751
but, you know, I want her
to have my babies, so...

561
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,835
<i>Our </i>babies.

562
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,964
Yeah.

563
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,591
I want it to be your home.

564
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,343
Yeah? You want me to live here with you?

565
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,303
I do.

566
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,554
You know,

567
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,265
I have found the one.

568
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,858
I was in love once before.

569
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,945
And I loved that person very much, but...

570
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:01,453
I knew that there were going to be
problems, always.

571
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,957
Things that I couldn't get past.

572
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,709
But with Lauren...

573
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,296
I don't have those concerns.

574
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,010
I would love to. I do love my place.

575
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,472
I think that the location is excellent
of my place.

576
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,389
Mm-hmm.

577
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,099
How would you feel if I kept it?

578
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,893
Um, well...

579
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,091
I don't know.

580
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,939
- Okay.
- Yeah.

581
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,609
I mean, does that bother you? Like...

582
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,986
Why are you laughing?

583
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,155
- Nothing. You seem uncomfortable.
- Really?

584
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,822
I'm not trying to rush you.

585
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,496
- Yeah.
- But, you know...

586
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,246
Okay.

587
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:50,335
I am feeling a lot of different emotions.

588
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,671
Thinking of, like...

589
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,549
Wow, I could really just
be giving up my personal space forever.

590
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,426
And I really enjoy my personal space.

591
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,971
But being in a marriage
kind of changes everything.

592
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,642
So I'm just trying to listen to myself
and my heart,

593
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,519
and my mind, at the same time.

594
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,106
This is all feeling quite real.

595
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,359
- It's feeling quite real right now.
- It's very real.

596
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,237
We're not in the pods anymore. I know.

597
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,197
This is your real life.

598
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,451
Yeah. It's overwhelming.

599
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,871
<i>♪ I'm walking on wires lately ♪</i>

600
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:31,710
<i>♪ I'm keeping my balance
But I don't think I can finish this ♪</i>

601
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,588
<i>♪ I won't get too ambitious
No ♪</i>

602
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,883
Here is my home.

603
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,262
Aw, baby, it's so little.

604
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,140
- No!
- Just kidding.

605
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,428
- I kinda want that...
- It's cute.

606
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,727
It's huge!

607
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,646
My house has one bedroom.

608
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,523
It feels like if I have kids,

609
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,897
like, we're always going to be
on top of each other.

610
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,944
- I like it. What?
- It's alright.

611
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,071
- What do you mean?
- It gets the job done.

612
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,155
My house is a mess.

613
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,575
I mean, my carpets are dirty
because I got a dog,

614
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,869
and she pees a little, sometimes, inside.

615
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,496
I don't want her to think less of me
because of my house.

616
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,082
I think, just the way it looks,
the size of it.

617
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,751
Hi!

618
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,544
Hi, pretty girl.

619
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,587
Hi, baby.

620
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,214
Oh, God, she's huge. Hi, Coda.

621
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,341
- Did you miss me?
- Come on. Hi.

622
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,053
Oh! You actually have furniture.

623
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,638
I do have furniture.

624
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,056
You...

625
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,935
It's not as bad as
I thought it was gonna be.

626
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:35,023
- It's nice, baby. I like it.
- I got papers here and there.

627
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,151
These are my stairs.
That hole in the wall is from Coda.

628
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,361
- Oh, boy.
- Never fixed.

629
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,322
How did she put a hole in the wall?

630
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,325
She's very clumsy.
I pick my girls clumsy, too.

631
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,952
- Oh, that's fair.
- She runs too fast.

632
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,954
- This... This is the bed.
- Ooh!

633
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,038
The bedroom.

634
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,960
Really?
You couldn't even make your bed?

635
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,334
Come on.

636
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,170
This is me and Coda's bed.
It's me and Coda's bed.

637
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,713
I didn't know when I'd be back.

638
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,549
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

639
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,093
- I fits.
- It's a big tub.

640
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,596
If I fits, I sits. I like this.

641
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,766
- I don't know if I'd sit down in there.
- What did you do to the bathtub?

642
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,643
- Nothing!
- Oh my God. What?

643
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,520
Oh, hold on. Closet.

644
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,313
- Closets?
- Can you get the...

645
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,439
Okay, all right.

646
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,776
You got all this space and you can't even
keep your clothes hung up?

647
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,951
Coda, what have you been doing with
this fool?

648
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,238
You haven't trained him yet?

649
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,132
I'm sorry, okay?

650
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,743
So I am a little less responsible
than Barnett

651
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,329
in terms of my assets.

652
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,833
I never really worked towards the future.

653
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,168
I never thought about having a home.

654
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:41,881
I was more of a "work just enough,
so that I could enjoy my life."

655
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,068
You're gonna get
all the dog hair on your ass.

656
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,306
Since the place that I'm living in now
isn't really even mine,

657
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,768
and I'm not going to be living there
much longer anyways,

658
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:58,189
I'm just really excited to move into
B's house with him

659
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,358
and start making our home there.

660
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:04,320
I would love to be a stay-at-home mom,
and right here and now,

661
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,865
as far as I'm concerned, it's our house,

662
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,701
and our family that may
or may not be started there.

663
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:13,621
It's our relationship that's
gonna grow in that home.

664
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,997
That's all I care about.

665
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,417
My house is very small.

666
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,793
If we do move out of here,

667
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,129
we'll be getting another loan
for another house.

668
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,257
I have an average credit score.
It's not great, but it's not bad.

669
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,218
But also because I've only got
one credit card.

670
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,180
It's my makeup credit card,
but it's only a $700 limit.

671
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,600
Still seems pretty high for makeup.

672
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,601
I'm at the limit.

673
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,145
You think that. Okay, makeup is expensive!

674
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,023
Wait, you have makeup credit card debt?

675
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,691
I do, I do.

676
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,944
It's really easy to run that up
really quickly, okay?

677
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,948
And I think the last time
that I actually used it,

678
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,118
I spent like, over $200 in one spree.

679
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,246
- On makeup?
- It's expensive!

680
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,124
So, uh, you know...

681
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,295
Oh, and then there's my student debt

682
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,381
from where I never graduated college.

683
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,259
How much are we talking about?

684
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,595
Well, around about 20 grand...

685
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,057
that I have not been paying on.

686
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,035
- You haven't been paying?
- I have not.

687
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,143
- No.
- Oh.

688
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,938
I have been pushing it off, and off...

689
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,482
So it just gets worse,
and worse, and worse.

690
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,405
- Do you pay the minimum at least, or no?
- No. I haven't paid anything.

691
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,903
I've been out of work,

692
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,280
or I was homeless for a while

693
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,825
and I was, like, couch-surfing between,
you know, my friends' homes.

694
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,119
How many days a week
do you typically work?

695
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,620
As many as I want.

696
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,793
I work to live. I don't live to work.

697
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,135
I think she knows you're stressed.

698
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,579
Are you sure you want to marry me?

699
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,694
Wow.

700
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,070
Alright.

701
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,656
- I love the style.
- Thanks.

702
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,577
Who is it? Hi!

703
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,163
Hi, pumpkin!

704
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,748
- And, wow.
- This is my house.

705
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,961
If there's anything I ever pictured of,
like, you, it's like this.

706
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,005
This is my room.

707
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,673
- Wow.
- Relax.

708
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,634
Seriously, you're way more
color-coordinated than I am.

709
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,430
I feel like I've come a really long way
in my career

710
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,516
and I'm really secure in where I'm at.

711
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:42,395
But being on the road can be really lonely

712
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,648
and coming home is usually the worst part.

713
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,192
Um, because you realize there's no one
to come home to.

714
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:52,655
So it's awesome having him here,
and opening up my reality to him.

715
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,161
I'm someone who wants kids,
and I'm no stranger to science.

716
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:03,958
So, like, I realize that if I want
three kids I probably have to start soon.

717
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,643
- Mm-hmm.
- At some point.

718
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,878
Dude, if I'm 24,

719
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,088
I don't want to be having kids
in, like, a year.

720
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,593
You know? Like, that's like very young.

721
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,179
- So, I'm gonna be like...
- My parents were, like, 20.

722
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,306
My parents... Like, my dad was your age.

723
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,100
My mom was, like, 19.

724
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,727
So here's my thing.

725
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,646
Again, I'm not your average 24-year-old
that is like...

726
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,857
I've done, like, whatever.

727
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,652
I've partied, I've hung out,
I've lived my life, had experiences.

728
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,779
- Yeah.
- Cool.

729
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,989
I'm ready for the next phase of my life.

730
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,284
Like, that doesn't stress me out,
the thought of having kids.

731
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,496
Guys my age aren't ready for kids.

732
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:46,501
You know, that's something that will drive
guys 35-plus away.

733
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,629
And I think that's one of the biggest,

734
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,928
you know, reservations for me
is I look at Mark

735
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,675
who's like, "Oh, yeah, I'm ready for kids!
Yes, of course I am!"

736
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,803
And it's like, "Really?"

737
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,515
I don't want him to settle down with me
and then regret it.

738
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,850
Okay, so let's play this out.

739
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,437
- We have a kid, and I'm like, 36.
- You look good.

740
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,064
You're 26.

741
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,023
Cool.

742
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,776
- The kid turns 14.
- Mm-hmm.

743
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,653
- I'm 50.
- Okay.

744
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,446
- You're 40.
- Okay.

745
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,490
How do you feel about that?

746
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,410
- Just... It doesn't bother me at all.
- No?

747
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,578
Mm-mm.

748
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,581
- At all. And I know that sounds...
- Okay, let's play it out further.

749
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,626
- Okay.
- The kid turns 24. I'm 60.

750
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,710
Mm-hmm.

751
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,380
- He's 24, I'm <i>60.</i>
- And I'm 50.

752
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,298
At that point it's... What, we're both...

753
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,426
- Yeah.
- Okay. We're both in our 50s and 60s.

754
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,887
It doesn't scare me.

755
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,391
Like, look me in the eyes.
I can look you in the eyes...

756
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,074
- Yeah.
- ...and say it doesn't scare me.

757
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,062
Biologically, yes, I understand the...

758
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,898
Okay, as a woman you...
We have to do this soon.

759
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,109
She keeps throwing scenarios at me,

760
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,611
saying, "When I'm 50 and you're 60,"
and I'm like, "And?"

761
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,572
Like it doesn't matter
about the age.

762
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,031
It's gonna be us.

763
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:03,911
Okay, so, then in 10 years,

764
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,247
if the kid's, like, eight years old...

765
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,165
Mm-hmm.

766
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:12,336
...and I want to move to California
or I want to move back to Chicago,

767
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,547
and that's when your parents would be
75 years old,

768
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,549
and you told me
you want to take care of them.

769
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,632
Mm-hmm.

770
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,344
So, how does that then come into play?

771
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,016
I'm not shouldering that burden by myself.
Me and my sister are both responsible.

772
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,559
And my parents aren't people

773
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,604
that are going to be
the type of people that be burdens.

774
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,898
You know what I'm saying?
Like, I want to put...

775
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,126
You do not know what's going
to happen to your parents.

776
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:38,654
- And that's what... I'm being very careful.
- And I don't want to say anything at all.

777
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,909
All I know for right now is that
my decision, what I feel here,

778
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,411
is that whenever I have to
make a decision...

779
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,039
Say we move to California with our kids,

780
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,958
- I'm going to make that with you.
- Yeah.

781
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,961
Not with the influence of, like,
what my mom thinks.

782
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,880
Because my mom will always support
what I do.

783
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,674
Mark is very
emotionally available.

784
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,010
To me, it's a bit of a red flag,

785
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,388
because no guy is that
emotionally available.

786
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,598
I've never seen it.

787
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,683
Never experienced it.

788
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:12,563
It's like we're watching an experiment
on Discovery Channel, for all I know.

789
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:16,192
I mean, he's...
Everything I say, he's up for it.

790
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:21,072
Thinking about, like, if we're to take
the next step in three weeks

791
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,616
and kind of, like, playing that all out,

792
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,160
you know, I think, like, the leading...

793
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,789
reason for divorce is, like, finances.

794
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,500
I've never thought about anybody, really,
other than myself,

795
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,629
because I've never been married
or had a kid or anything like that,

796
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,964
but things happen very quickly

797
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:42,468
and you want to make sure that you're able
to provide that security and comfort.

798
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:47,223
For a long time in my professional life
I wasn't making six figures, you know?

799
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,183
And then, like,
it feels like, once it happens,

800
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:53,020
it just kind of, like,
continues to grow from there.

801
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,273
In this moment right now,

802
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,776
I'm not the financial provider.
I know that.

803
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,987
I'm going to be honest,
I'm not going to lie to you.

804
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,824
- Yeah. That's okay.
- And, you know, that's just being real.

805
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,869
You know, I'm not making,
like, $100,000, you know?

806
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,955
But I know now,

807
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:14,166
with what I know with fitness
and where I want to go with it,

808
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,795
I just want you to know that, like,
I may not be, like, there yet,

809
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:18,921
but I'm, I'm...

810
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,424
I hope you see my mindset
of where I'm gonna be.

811
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,136
This isn't gonna be butterflies
and rainbows all the time,

812
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,679
and that's why you see me tonight...

813
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,514
I challenged him and challenged him.

814
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,851
Because, you know, I want this to be
successful at the end of the day,

815
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,438
and I don't want us, you know,
in three weeks to walk down the aisle,

816
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,939
and this all be for nothing.

817
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,107
Um...

818
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,903
But what are your thoughts around,
like, kind of like gender roles

819
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,198
and how they play into managing finances?

820
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,410
Again, I refer back to my mom,
and how she is, you know what I'm saying?

821
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,454
And I see a lot of qualities similar.

822
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,790
And so my mom has always been that,
like, rock.

823
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,293
She's always been my rock solid, like...
That's my woman.

824
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,003
And that's why I'm attracted to you.

825
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,255
Yeah, you're amazing,
and not just what you...

826
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,716
The physical features.
It's you as a person.

827
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,677
I want to be me, though.
I don't want to be your mom.

828
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,806
And I get that, like,
you want to channel your parents,

829
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,809
but you have to be you
at the end of the day.

830
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,604
You're a grown-ass man, you know?

831
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:17,813
I wouldn't...

832
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,483
I don't want you to be...
Trust me, like, I'm good.

833
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,376
Like, same thing, mentally. I'm good.
Like, you know what I mean?

834
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,655
I'm not saying it's, like, I want you
to be a parent, you know what I mean?

835
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,925
- I'm not telling you...
- I don't want to be your parent.

836
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,493
Or in comparison to my mom...

837
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,412
I know you don't, and I'm just
setting the ground straight now.

838
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,081
You compare so much to your mom,

839
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,059
I want to make sure you're keeping things
in perspective.

840
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,167
Yeah, yeah!

841
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,628
I'm not trying to recreate
your parents' marriage

842
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,755
- or something like that.
- I would never want that.

843
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,924
Or recreate your mom.
I'll never live up to your mom.

844
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,217
I'll never be your mom.

845
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,928
Like, you've explained her to me
a million times,

846
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,972
- I am never going to be your mom.
- I'm just proud of her, basically.

847
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,849
- No, and I love that.
- And I say that...

848
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,227
That's where my head was at,
and it's, like...

849
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,622
- I don't want somebody...
- Girls get intimidated by that.

850
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,272
No one lives up to Mom. Ever.

851
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,524
No one can live up to Mom.

852
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,109
- Trust me...
- And I'm not trying to.

853
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,778
And I would never want you to.
There's no competition.

854
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,697
There's no competition,
because my heart is open to you.

855
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,367
I don't want you to think you need
to compete with my mom.

856
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,160
He won't stop talking about his mom.

857
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,788
And I'm like... dude.

858
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,416
There is no comparison between you
and my mom.

859
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,085
My mom is separate, and she is...

860
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,129
My mom will love whoever loves me,

861
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,090
and I will love whoever I love
because I love them.

862
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,467
I don't seek the approval of my mom.

863
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,719
I understand.
Your mom's an incredible woman.

864
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,638
I can't imagine how incredible she is.

865
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:37,309
But every single topic,
we relate back to Mom.

866
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,938
Going into a marriage,
if I'm really being realistic,

867
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:44,442
like, I would definitely want to put like
a prenup in place.

868
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,819
Like, off the bat.

869
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,822
I genuinely love this person.

870
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,533
And so that's what's confusing me.

871
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,785
It's not like we didn't talk about this
in the pods.

872
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,079
You knew how old I was. You knew!

873
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,624
And you ignored it. You said,
"Whatever, I want you."

874
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,002
You knew what I did for a living.

875
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,587
You said, "Okay."

876
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,048
You knew everything about me
in those pods.

877
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,050
You said "yes" to me twice.

878
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,596
Once behind a wall, and once in person.

879
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,763
You could have easily...

880
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,891
When you saw me in person,
you said "You know what?

881
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,142
No. I'm good."

882
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,976
But you said yes.

883
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,269
Um...

884
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,367
<i>♪ On the way last night ♪</i>

885
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,539
<i>♪ You said we could be anyone ♪</i>

886
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:45,085
Because we've kind of been sequestered
because of this whole experiment,

887
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,087
we haven't really told his family yet.

888
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,006
None of his friends know yet.

889
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,759
So, for Barnett's birthday

890
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,885
I am trying to get

891
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:59,058
all of our fellow experimentees together

892
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,436
and just kind of have like
a little birthday celebration for him.

893
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,120
- What's up?
- What's up?

894
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,024
Happy birthday!

895
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,401
- Blow them out, babe.
- Blow it out!

896
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,197
They weren't trick candles.

897
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,533
I was really expecting trick candles.

898
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,968
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Happy birthday, Barnett.

899
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:17,992
Thank you.

900
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,436
- What's up, buddy? How you doing?
- Oh, I'm doing all right.

901
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,831
You surprised?

902
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,668
- A little bit.
- A little bit? Just a little bit?

903
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,170
Don't get too excited,
it's all downhill from here.

904
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,174
Bam bam.

905
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,175
Birthday shots.

906
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,843
Are we doing shots?

907
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,012
- To Barnett.
- To Barnett.

908
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,430
To Barnett!

909
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,141
- Happy birthday, Barnett.
- Happy birthday, Barnett.

910
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,725
Baby!

911
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,363
Yes!

912
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,509
I had these expectations, like,
it's going to be a happy-go-lucky life.

913
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,702
I thought when I found her,
that was my pot of gold.

914
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,121
No, no, no. That was the start of it.

915
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,622
That was the beginning of it.

916
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,333
I found the rainbow.
Now it's time to go on that journey

917
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,876
and find what it is.

918
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,589
It kind of sucks for me because, like,
he's such a girls' guy.

919
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,674
- Who? Uh, Cameron?
- Mark.

920
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,757
Oh, Mark.

921
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,471
- Being in love is terrifying.
- Preach.

922
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,683
And the more in love I keep falling
with Barnett,

923
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,852
the more scared I am that some...

924
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:30,024
screw is going to be thrown into,
all of these, these working gears,

925
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,692
and something is going to mess up.

926
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,775
And it's...

927
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,404
- You can't do that though.
- I know, it's...

928
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,487
You can't, dude.

929
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,949
I try not to think about it
on a daily basis,

930
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,118
because I'm so excited
for how things are working.

931
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,746
- Then be excited.
- I can't lose a love like this again,

932
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,705
for any reason.

933
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,373
I think it would destroy me.

934
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,252
I know it's so easy to say,
because even in my situation, I'm like,

935
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,630
I don't know
what's going to happen tomorrow.

936
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,596
Because I don't want to lose
a love like this.

937
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,551
I look at her every morning,
and I'm like, "Fuck...

938
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,429
What did I do to deserve that?"

939
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,433
I'm just someone
that usually likes the unassuming,

940
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:08,145
laid-back guy that's not like,
talking about emotions with girls.

941
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,397
And Mark is very, like, out there.

942
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,818
Don't put so much pressure
on making it work, and just enjoy.

943
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,697
Live, breathe,
because you finally deserve something.

944
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,866
So do you have feelings for someone else?

945
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,326
- No.
- No?

946
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,203
Mm-mm, mm-mm. Nope.

947
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,247
So it's not, like, somebody else
is in the background.

948
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,124
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

949
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,626
If it... If you...

950
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,711
- Oh!
- Oh!

951
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,795
Sorry y'all.

952
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,213
When I get married,

953
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:39,802
I do want to make sure
that it's the right person.

954
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:43,555
I guess I looked back,
and I actually looked at a journal entry.

955
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,391
I was so excited about Barnett.

956
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,560
I did connect with him on such
a deep level,

957
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,356
and I was very passionate about
that connection.

958
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,149
And I thought, "Oh, this must be it."

959
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,318
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

960
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,154
I'm really glad that I got this.

961
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,892
It's the only thing I cared about.

962
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,993
Dude, What is it?

963
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,662
IPA? No, that's perfect.

964
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,414
- That's so good.
- "Ippa." I love ippas.

965
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,497
So good.

966
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,877
- We're like right next door to it, too.
- We're right next door? What's you're...

967
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:14,961
It's across the street.

968
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,714
- What's your apartment?
- What?

969
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,997
- What's your apartment?
- We're... We're two floors up.

970
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,635
So I don't know if you're ever
on the balcony,

971
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,679
but I can look down and spit on you.

972
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,348
I keep being naked in front of the window,
and I'm like,

973
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,183
"Oh, I forget I live in an apartment now."

974
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,395
- Yeah, that's my problem, too.
- My...

975
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,063
My bad.

976
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,273
Sorry, guys.

977
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,150
Always naked.

978
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,651
So what's up? How's, uh...

979
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,570
How are things?

980
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,654
Things are okay.

981
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,115
Things are okay.

982
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,871
I'm not...

983
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,959
I'm not there.
You know what I mean?

984
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,879
Like, me and Mark are so dissimilar
that it's...

985
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,172
- Really?
- It's like...

986
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,966
Yeah. I mean, we're 10 years apart.
We're like...

987
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,718
Different decades.

988
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,094
Different decades.

989
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,263
Like, you name it, like, we're different.

990
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,474
And... all those things.

991
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,017
Why did you say yes, then?

992
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,229
Shit.

993
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,441
I think I was so...

994
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,943
I was coming down off of us.

995
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,737
Caught up in the experience, yeah.

996
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,864
There were 48 hours in the day.

997
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,116
I thought about you for, like,
46 of those hours.

998
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,451
Like, it was insane.

999
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,827
Yeah?

1000
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,038
Yeah.

1001
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,789
I was like...

1002
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,542
I, like, was so high on that,
and then, like...

1003
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,546
Then you said,
"No, I didn't feel the same way,"

1004
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,590
and I...

1005
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,261
I was coming off of that.

1006
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:50,265
Like, I was like,
"This is what I've always gone after,

1007
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,517
and it's not worked."

1008
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,978
And here I am, and this person's liked me
since day one.

1009
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,524
And then I was like, "Oh, this person's
loved me since the beginning."

1010
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,361
Like, it's so, like,
my whole life playing out

1011
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:05,405
and, like,
maybe I should just go with that, like...

1012
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,615
I don't know.

1013
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,284
Um...

1014
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,286
Sounds like it's meant to be.

1015
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,211
I know.

1016
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,623
Oh!

1017
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,143
Oh!

1018
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,210
Oh, God.

1019
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:19,961
It's over there.

1020
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,047
I threw it...
I threw it closer, a little bit.

1021
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,425
So how are you feeling about Amber?
Is she everything you expected?

1022
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,219
Uh, she's...

1023
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,973
Actually, it's more than I expected, so...
Which is good.

1024
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,601
She definitely gets me
out of my comfort zone, like...

1025
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,896
You never struck me
as a person that would go for Amber.

1026
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,899
And it's weird to see it
all come together.

1027
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,235
- I'm like, holy shit.
- You told me that a couple times.

1028
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,318
We both have pasts.

1029
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,280
Do you feel you guys are
emotionally connected?

1030
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,074
I know y'all are obviously,
like, physically, and, like...

1031
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,744
What I don't want is, like,
for you to feel some sort of,

1032
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,539
like, physical, sexual thing that, like...

1033
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,124
And then you're married, and, like,

1034
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:01,628
two weeks down the road you're like,
"Fuck, I don't have things in common

1035
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,548
withthis person
on an intellectual level."

1036
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,301
I want to make sure that y'all are there.

1037
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,346
I know it may seem like we're always,
on top of each other and stuff,

1038
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,431
but we're not.

1039
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,475
Aww, shenanigans. Where's...

1040
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,139
They're over there talking.

1041
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,230
I do just want to revisit
for like a minute, like,

1042
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,733
the fact that, like,
you were so confused two weeks ago.

1043
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,527
I want to make sure that...

1044
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:32,576
you're doing what's right for you,
you know?

1045
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,829
I found someone who's gonna love me
a hundred percent, no matter what.

1046
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,456
I think so, too.

1047
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,000
Her whole life is you. That's it.

1048
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,128
- Her whole life is you.
- I know.

1049
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,380
You deserve it. You do.

1050
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,423
Hey.

1051
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,469
Nothing will ever break
the bond we made.

1052
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,720
I know, I know.

1053
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,430
- Literally.
- We had a friendship.

1054
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,975
We do. And honestly, like, I...

1055
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:58,936
want the best for you.

1056
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,146
So, like, if anything ever comes up,
you fucking...

1057
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,230
You reach out to me.

1058
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,606
Yeah.

1059
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,486
Jessica probably had
a little too much fun.

1060
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,657
I never felt like there was anything
I had to worry about with my fiancé,

1061
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,660
but if I felt like she stepped
over the line one more time,

1062
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,994
I would break her face.

1063
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,870
I adore you.

1064
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,497
Aw.

1065
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,249
Bless her heart.

1066
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,126
Uh...

1067
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,588
Mm. I love you the most.

1068
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,422
Love you, too.

1069
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,384
What's going on?

1070
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,303
Nothing, baby.

1071
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,973
- I know. I'm just happy, I'm good.
- Have a drink.

1072
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:37,891
Hey, you know...

1073
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,231
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1074
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,940
Ah.

1075
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,820
So good.

1076
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,531
I don't know where Jessica's head's
at right now.

1077
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,866
Easy deasies.

1078
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,745
The situation is very hot and cold.

1079
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,069
I don't know what I'm going to get on
a day-to-day basis.

1080
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,002
Oh, it's so close.
Hey, how'd that rim job go?

1081
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,878
How'd that rim job go?

1082
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,551
And when she's all over me,
and hugging me and kissing me,

1083
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,261
it confuses the fuck out of me.

1084
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,344
What?

1085
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,392
Does it feel pretty natural,
living together now?

1086
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,477
Do you feel like it's pretty comfortable?

1087
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,647
Why do you keep looking at me? Go ahead.

1088
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:29,234
Uh, I mean, yeah, it's...
We've had some difficulties just, like...

1089
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,402
adjusting.

1090
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:35,198
More so me,
because I'm used to being alone.

1091
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,409
- I can see that.
- Yeah.

1092
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,954
- Lauren's like a roadblock. She's like...
- Fuck you, Damien.

1093
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:45,125
"I can see that,
you being a lonely, bitter hag."

1094
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,460
No, no, I just like...

1095
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,880
What is wrong with you, Damian? What?

1096
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,767
I just try to put a smile
on people's faces,

1097
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,509
and sometimes saying awkward,
unconventional things...

1098
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,845
- Yeah?
- It brings out the best in people.

1099
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:57,928
It does.

1100
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,057
And I'm not afraid to do that.

1101
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,143
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1102
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,062
Is that sarcastic? You mean that?

1103
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,439
No. I totally mean that.

1104
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,441
Stop putting her on the spot.

1105
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,735
I know, like... Very awkward.

1106
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:15,197
I picked up
that the conversation was awkward.

1107
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,949
That caused me to feel uncomfortable
towards my fiancé.

1108
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,287
I'm like...

1109
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,538
I don't know how I feel.

1110
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,917
I'm confused by the whole conversation.

1111
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,878
Gigi and Damien are like
<i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

1112
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:30,961
It's hard to crack.

1113
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,301
I'm not lying when I say
that I'm still trying to read you.

1114
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,637
The problem is
you're reading into things too much.

1115
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,930
I am, but I don't have...

1116
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,599
I feel like I don't have a choice,
and it's really bothering me.

1117
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:47,896
When I feel things were being awkward...
Like, I didn't like that.

1118
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,483
Then talk to me.
Don't make a scene by walking off.

1119
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,860
Giannina is the love of my life.

1120
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,781
We've built such a strong connection,
and I'm scared of losing that.

1121
00:51:58,698 --> 00:51:59,783
Scared of losing her.

1122
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,410
So I didn't stomp off
because I had a little bitch fit.

1123
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:06,748
I stomped off because I'm not processing
things correctly, so I left.

1124
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,042
You said I made things awkward,
but they're, like,

1125
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,669
"What just happened with her?"

1126
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,815
You want to know the reason
why I walked away?

1127
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,133
It was because I don't care
what goes on in there

1128
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,338
and you feel like things are awkward
and that's fine.

1129
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,011
I didn't feel comfortable, right?

1130
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,931
So what I said was,
"That's not what she felt."

1131
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,351
How do you know what she felt?
You're not Lauren.

1132
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,476
Listen to me.

1133
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,020
Stop interrupting me, please,
for the love of God.

1134
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,524
Stop speaking for everyone else
and speak for G.

1135
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,960
- I'm trying.
- You're not.

1136
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,344
You're speaking for everyone else.

1137
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,922
- You're not listening to me.
- You're speaking for everyone else.

1138
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,073
You're not listening.
You're not even letting me talk.

1139
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,616
You're bringing me down.

1140
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,820
You're bringing <i>me</i> down!

1141
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,054
You're not letting me speak,
you're not listening to me.

1142
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,247
- I have been listening.
<i>- </i>Motherfucker.

1143
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,000
Listen. For two seconds.

1144
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,587
I have listened to you since the day
we walked into the pods together.

1145
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,339
- Not in person.
- I process. I have.

1146
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,592
This is what we were wondering
was missing.

1147
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,759
Social situations.

1148
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,721
Because I don't like to be
in awkward situations,

1149
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,097
which you willingly do.

1150
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,224
The difference is, G, is when things are
too good...

1151
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,143
No, when things are comfortable,

1152
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,228
you self-sabotage as you always say.

1153
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,229
And you will bring...

1154
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,315
You don't care
what you destruct In the process.

1155
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,838
You don't care if you bring me down.

1156
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,402
If I didn't care about bringing you down,

1157
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,071
I would have been, "That was awkward."

1158
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:23,033
- We've talked about this.
- Why wouldn't I have done that?

1159
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,659
Motherfucker, listen to me.

1160
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:30,332
My fucking heart feels like
it's breaking right now.

00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,742
- Hey, I love you.
- Love you.

1169
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,535
What happened earlier?

1170
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,247
I was just with Gigi all night
and it was crazy,

1171
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,707
so I had to talk to her tonight, I had to.

1172
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,834
- I know.
- She's the greatest.

1173
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,795
She's a close second.

1174
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,299
I'm talking about you being the greatest.

1175
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,551
That was kind of a compliment.
I'm not saying, like...

1176
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,720
You don't say somebody's a close second.

1177
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,639
No, that's not what I meant.

1178
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,600
This is a girl I look at, like,
literally as my little sister.

1179
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:31,810
Baby, baby, baby.

1180
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,688
- You're a close second.
- Babe.

1181
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,651
- How is that? You're a close second.
- You're taking that the wrong way.

1182
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:38,984
Babe, babe, babe.

1183
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,653
Seriously, I'm not...
I did not mean it like that.

1184
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,155
Stop. I was... Listen, straight up.

1185
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,117
All I was talking about was you.

1186
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,202
I was... I'm sorry that it was a bad joke.

1187
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,578
I apologize for that.

1188
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,163
- It's the worst.
- Okay.

1189
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,375
Honestly, literally, she's older than you

1190
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,460
- and she's beautiful and amazing.
- Okay.

1191
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,962
And you're beautiful and amazing.

1192
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,548
And, literally, you're like,
"Oh, she's a close second."

1193
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,650
- No.
- Get the fuck out of here.

1194
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,801
That's not
what I was trying to say like that.

1195
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,054
I think Barnett is fuckin' sexy
and, like, hot, and, like...

1196
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,007
What the fuck is that?

1197
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,350
You're insulting me like that.
Don't insult me like that.

1198
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,102
Are you fucking kidding me?

1199
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,191
- Baby, baby.
- I'm good.

1200
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,203
It's confusing as hell.

1201
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,621
It's confusing.

1202
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,498
I don't know what she wants.

1203
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,752
She puts her ring on, she shows it off,
and then she puts it away.

1204
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,755
It's just like this huge back and forth,
just like...

1205
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,255
What do you want?

1206
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,842
If I get to the wedding day and...

1207
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,594
Jessica says no,

1208
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,763
I'm more alone than I've ever been.

1209
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:55,518
I never thought
it would happen like this.

1211

00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,320
